Council Regulation (EEC) No 900/92 of 31 March 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90 laying down measures to be taken to discourage the diversion of certain substances to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances




COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 900/92 of 31 March 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90 laying down measures to be taken to discourage the diversion of certain substances to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,


Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90 (1) laid down measures to be taken to discourage the diversion of certain substances to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances;


Whereas diversion patterns are rapidly changing and it is considered on the international level that the procedures identified by Article 12 of the UN Convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, hereinafter referred to as the 'United Nations Convention', need to be reinforced to effectively counter chemical diversion;


Whereas the Commission and seven Member States participated in the work of the Chemical Action Task Force created by the Houston Economic Submit (G-7) on 10 July 1990 to develop effective procedures to prevent diversion of precursor and essential chemicals to illicit drugs manufacture; whereas a full Community coordination was ensured throughout this work, as well as close consultation with representatives of trade and industry;


Whereas the Final Report of the Task Force was approved by the London Economic Summit (G-7) on 15 July 1991;


Whereas this Final Report, in recognizing the United Nations Convention as the basic instrument of international cooperation in chemical diversion matters, contains a number of recommendations for reinforcing national and international measures on the basis of that Convention;


Whereas some of the recommendations of the Task Force concern measures not covered by Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90, and in particular certain requirements with regard to the exportation of chemical substances, the extension of the list of chemical substances subject to international control, and a new category-based classification scheme providing for appropriate control measures according to the nature and trade patterns of the substances in each of the three categories established; whereas the substances in Category 3 in particular are widely traded on a licit basis and should be subjected to export authorization arrangements only when they are intended for certain sensitive countries, in order not to increase unnecessarily the burden of controls; whereas furthermore, the report recommends the strengthening of international cooperation by the conclusion of bilateral agreements, in particular between regions exporting and regions importing scheduled chemicals;


Whereas it appears important that the Community, in view of its commitment to the work of the Task Force, should implement the recommendations approved, and contribute as far as possible to international cooperation in this field;


Whereas, under the United Kingdom Nations Convention, amendments to Tables I and II of the Annex are proposed to the Commission on narcotic drugs of the economic and Social Council of the United Nations Organization,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/75/EEC of 22 September 1992 on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by household appliances


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas measures should be taken progressively to achieve the internal market by 31 December 1992;


Whereas certain Member States already have their own voluntary schemes for energy labelling and the provision of other energy consumption information for household appliances; whereas one Member State has formally proposed introducing its own compulsory labelling scheme, and other Member States are considering such introduction; whereas the existence of a number of compulsory national schemes would create barriers to intra-Community trade;


Whereas Article 130r of the Treaty requires prudent and rational utilization of natural resources; whereas the rational use of energy is one of the principal means by which this objective can be achieved and environmental pollution reduced;


Whereas the provision of accurate, relevant and comparable information on the specific energy consumption of household appliances may influence the public's choice in favour of those appliances which consume less energy, thus prompting manufacturers to take steps to reduce the consumption of the appliances which they manufacture; whereas it will also, indirectly, encourage the efficient use of these appliances; whereas, in the absence of this information, the operation of market forces alone will fail to promote the rational use of energy for these appliances;


Whereas information plays a key role in the operation of market forces and it is therefore necessary to introduce a uniform label for all appliances of the same type, to provide potential purchasers with supplementary standardized information on those appliances' costs in terms of energy and the consumption of other resources and to take measures to ensure that potential purchasers who do not see the appliance displayed, and thus have no opportunity to see the label, are also supplied with this information;


Whereas to this end the energy consumption of and other information concerning each type of appliance must be measured in accordance with harmonized standards and methods and the application of these standards and methods must be monitored at the marketing stage;


Whereas Directive 79/530/EEC (4) sought to promote these aims in the case of household appliances; whereas, however, only one implementing Directive for electric ovens has been adopted and few Member States have introduced this label; whereas it is therefore now necessary to learn from the experience acquired and to strengthen the provisions of that Directive; whereas Directive 79/530/EEC must therefore be replaced and Directive 79/531/EEC (5) applying to those electric ovens should be revised and subsequently integrated into the present scheme;


Whereas a completely voluntary scheme would lead to only some appliances being labelled, or supplied with standard product information, with the risk that this might result in confusion for some consumers; whereas the present scheme must therefore ensure that for all the appliances concerned, the energy consumption is indicated by labelling and standard product fiches are provided;


Whereas household appliances use a wide variety of forms of energy, with electricity and gas being the most important; whereas this Directive must therefore in principle cover appliances using any form of energy;


Whereas Council Directive 86/594/EEC of 1 December 1986 on airborne noise emitted by household appliances (6) provides for an indication of noise emission to be included on energy labels, where appropriate; whereas provision must therefore be made for the incorporation of any other information and labelling covered by Community schemes;


Whereas only those types of appliances whose aggregate energy use is significant and which afford adequate scope for increased efficiency need be included,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 92/1/EEC of 13 January 1992 on the monitoring of temperatures in the means of transport, warehousing and storage of quick-frozen foodstuffs intended for human consumption


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Directive 89/108/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to quick-frozen foods intended for human consumption (1), and in particular Article 11 thereof,


Whereas the legal provisions must, in this case, be restricted solely to the requirements that are necessary in order to meet essential and imperative needs regarding the monitoring of temperatures in means of transport, warehousing and storage in such a way as to ensure that the temperatures required by Article 5 of Directive 89/108/EEC are fully maintained;


Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Foodstuffs,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


Article 1


This Directive concerns the monitoring of temperatures in the means of transport, warehousing and storage for quick-frozen foods.


Article 2


1. The means of transport, warehousing and storage must be fitted with suitable recording instruments to monitor, at frequent and regular intervals, the air temperatures to which quick-frozen foods intended for human consumption are subjected.


In the case of transport, the measuring instruments must be approved by the competent authorities of the country in which means of transport is registered.


Temperature recordings obtained in this manner must be dated and stored by the operator for at least one year or longer according to the nature of food.


2. The air temperature during storage in retail display cabinets, and in the course of local distribution, shall be measured by at least one easily visible thermometer which, in the case of open retail display cabinets, shall indicate the temperature at the air return side at the level of the clearly marked maximum load line.


3. Member States may permit a derogation from paragraph 1 in the case of cold chambers of less than 10 cubic metres for storing stock in retail outlets, so as to permit the air temperature to be measured by an easily visible thermometer.


Article 3


Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions needed in order to comply with this Directive by 31 July 1993, except for railways for which the date of implementation will be decided later.


They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof.

Council Directive 92/46/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the health rules for the production and placing on the market of raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk-based products




COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/46/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the health rules for the production and placing on the market of raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk-based products


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,


Having regard to the proposals from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinions of the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinions of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas raw milk, heat-treated drinking milk, milk for the manufacture of milk-based products and milk-based products are included in the list of products in Annex II to the Treaty; whereas the production of and trade in such milk and products constitute an important source of income for the agricultural population;


Whereas, in order to ensure the rational development of this sector health rules governing the production and placing on the market of milk and milk-based products should be laid down at Community level;


Whereas this principle has already been followed in Council Directive 85/397/EEC of 5 August 1985 on health and animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in heat-treated milk (4);


Whereas the introduction of such rules will help to ensure a high level of protection of public health;


Whereas the Community has to adopt measures for the gradual establishment of the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992;


Whereas it seems necessary to exclude from the scope of this Directive certain products sold directly by the producer to the consumer;


Whereas, in order to create the conditions for the internal market, the principles and the rules on checks contained in Directive 89/662/EEC (5) should be extended to all production of milk-based products;


Whereas products placed on the Community market which come from third countries must afford the same degree of protection as regards human health; whereas guarantees equivalent to those offered by products of Community origin should therefore be required in respect of such products and they should be subject to the principles and rules on checks contained in Directive 90/675/EEC (6);


Whereas the hygiene rules must apply to the production, wrapping, storage and transport of the products covered by this Directive;


Whereas in order to ensure uniformity of checks at origin, it is necessary to provide for a procedure for the approval of establishments meeting the health conditions laid down in this Directive, to determine the requirements regarding conditions of hygienic production to be complied with by such establishments and to define the criteria to be met by the products covered by this Directive;


Whereas low-capacity establishments should be approved by means of simplified structure and infrastructure criteria, while complying with the rules of hygiene laid down in this Directive;


Whereas health marking of milk-based products is the best way of satisfying the competent authority of the place of destination that a consignment complies with the provisions of this Directive;


Whereas prime responsibility for compliance with the requirements of this Directive should lie with producers and the competent authority should be obliged to monitor application of this principle of own-checks;


Whereas, to ensure uniform application of this Directive, a Community inspection procedure should be established;


Whereas, in order to allow the time necessary to set up a Community inspection system to ensure that third countries comply with the guarantees provided for in this Directive, national rules on checks should be maintained for a transitional period as regards third countries;


Whereas the extension to all production of milk-based products of the hygiene rules laid down in Directive 85/397/EEC, adapted as necessary in the light of experience, make that Directive redundant;


Whereas the existing situation regarding health conditions for stock farms and production and processing structures differs from one Member State to another;


Whereas provision should therefore be made for gradual compliance with the standards laid down in this Directive and whereas a distinction should thus be maintained for the time being between trade and the national market;


Whereas certain milk-based products may be manufactured from raw milk; whereas, given the nature of these products, it may be necessary to draw up specific conditions applicable thereto and a list of such products as might be marketed;


Whereas account should be taken of certain special cheesemaking techniques;


Whereas Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer (7) and Council Directive 89/396/EEC of 14 June 1989 on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs (8) are applicable;


Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin (9), and in particular Annexes I and III thereto, is applicable as regards the maximum residue levels for pharmacologically active substances in milk;


Whereas the Commission should be entrusted with the task of adopting certain measures for implementing this Directive; whereas, to that end, a procedure should be laid down establishing close and effective cooperation between the Commission and the Member States within the Standing Veterinary Committee;


Whereas the adoption of specific rules for the products covered by this Directive is without prejudice to the adoption of rules on food hygiene and safety in general, on which the Commission has submitted a proposal for a framework Directive;


Whereas the deadline for transposition into national law, set at 1 January 1992 in Article 32, should not effect the abolition of veterinary checks at frontiers on 1 January 1993,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

CHAPTER III Hygiene in milking, the collection of raw milk and its transport from the production holding to the collection or standardization centre or to the treatment establishment or processing establishment - Hygiene of staff


A. Hygiene in milking


1. Milking must be carried out hygienically and under the conditions established by Directive 89/362/EEC.


() Council Directive 80/778/EEC of 15 July 1980 relating to the quality of water intended for human consumption (OJ No L 229, 30. 8. 1980, p. 11). Last amended by Directive 90/656/EEC (OJ No L 353, 17. 12. 1990, p. 59).


2. Immediately after milking, the milk must be placed in a clean place which is so equipped as to avoid adverse effects on the milk.


If the milk is not collected within two hours of milking, it must be cooled to a temperature of 8 oC or lower in the case of daily collection or 6 oC or lower if collection is not daily. While the milk is being transported to the treatment and/or processing establishment its temperature must not exceed 10 oC.


B. Hygiene of premises, equipment and tools


1. Equipment and instruments or their surfaces which are intended to come into contact with milk (utensils, containers, tanks, etc., intended for milking, collection or transport) must be made of smooth material which is easy to clean and disinfect, resists corrosion and does not transfer substances to the milk in such quantities as to endanger human health, impair the composition of the milk or adversely affect its organoleptic characteristics.


2. After use, the utensils used for milking, the mechanical milking equipment and the containers which come into contact with the milk must be cleaned and disinfected. After each journey, or after each series of journeys where there is only a very short space of time between unloading and the following loading, but in any event at least once a day, containers and tanks used for transporting raw milk to the milk collection or standardization centre or to the milk treatment or processing establishment must be cleaned and disinfected before reuse.


C. Staff hygiene


1. Absolute cleanliness shall be required of staff. Specifically:


(a) persons performing milking and handling raw milk must wear suitable clean milking clothes;


(b) milkers must wash their hands immediately before the milking commences and keep them clean as far as practicable throughout the milking.


For this purpose, near the place of milking, suitable facilities are required to enable persons performing milking or handling raw milk to wash their hands and arms.


2. The employer shall take all the requisite measures to prevent persons liable to contaminate raw milk from handling it, until there is evidence that such persons can do so without risk of contamination.


Any person performing milking or handling raw milk shall be required to show that there is no medical impediment to such employment. The medical supervision of such a person shall be governed by the national legislation in force in the Member State concerned or in the case of third countries by specific guarantees to be fixed under the procedure laid down in Article 31 of this Directive.


D. Production hygiene


1. A monitoring system shall be established under the supervision of the competent authority to prevent water being added to raw milk. This system shall in particular include regular checks on the freezing point of milk from each production facility, in accordance with the following procedure:


(a) the raw milk of each holding must be checked regularly by random sampling. Where the milk of a single holding is delivered directly to a treatment or processing establishment, these samples are to be taken either when the milk is collected from the holding, provided that precautions are taken to prevent any fraud during transport, or before unloading at the treatment or processing establishment when the milk is delivered there directly by the farmer.


If the results of a check lead the competent authority to suspect that water is being added, it shall take an authentic sample on the holding. An authentic sample is a sample representing the milk of one completely supervised morning or evening milking beginning not less than eleven hours or more than thirteen hours after the previous milking.


Where milk is delivered from several holdings, samples may only be taken when the raw milk enters the treatment or processing establishment or collection or standardization centre, provided that spot checks are, however, carried out on the holdings.


If the results of a check lead to suspicion that water has been added, samples shall be taken at all holdings which took part in the collection of the raw milk at issue.


If necessary, the competent authority shall take authentic samples within the meaning of the second subparagraph above;


(b) if the results of the check show that water has not been added, the raw milk may be used for producing raw drinking milk, heat-treated milk or milk for the manufacture of milk-based products for human consumption.


2. The treatment and/or processing establishment shall inform the competent authority when the maximum standards fixed for the plate count and somatic cell count have been reached. The competent authority shall take the appropriate measures.


3. If, within three months of notification of the results of the checks referred to in point 1 (a) and of the investigation provided for in Chapter IV.D, and after the standards of Chapter IV have been exceeded, milk from the holding in question does not meet those standards, that holding shall no longer be authorized to supply raw milk until such milk again meets the said standards.


Milk must not be used for human consumption if it contains antibiotic residues in a quantity which, in respect of any one of the substances referred to in Annexes I and III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 (), exceeds the levels authorized therein; the combined total of residues of antibiotic substances may not exceed a value to be fixed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 31 of this Directive.

ANNEX C


CHAPTER I Requirements for the manufacture of heat-treated milk and milk-based products


A. Requirements for the production of heat-treated drinking milk


1. Heat-treated drinking milk must be obtained from raw milk which complies with the standards laid down in Annex A, Chapter IV.


2. Upon acceptance at a treatment establishment milk must, unless treated within four hours of acceptance, be cooled to a temperature not exceeding +6 oC and maintained at that temperature until heat-treated.


If raw milk is not treated within 36 hours of acceptance, a further test must be carried out on that milk before it is heat-treated. If it is found by means of a direct or indirect method that the plate count of that milk at 30 oC exceeds 300 000 per ml the milk in question must not be used for the production of heat-treated drinking milk.


3. The manufacture of heat-treated drinking milk shall include all necessary measures, in particular random sampling checks, relating to:


(a) the plate count, to ensure that:


- raw milk, if it is not treated within 36 hours of acceptance, does not exceed immediately before heat treatment a plate count at 30 oC of 300 000 per ml,


- milk which has been subjected to a previous pasteurzation has, immediately before the second heat treatment, a plate count at 30 oC not exceeding 100 000 per ml;


(b) the presence of extraneous water in the milk


Heat-treated drinking milk shall be subjected to regular checks for the presence of extraneous water, in particular by verification of the freezing point. For this purpose a control system shall be established under the supervision of the competent authority. When extraneous water is detected the competent authority shall take appropriate measures.


In establishing a control system the competent authority shall take account of;


- the results of the checks on raw milk referred to in Annex A, Chapter III D.1, and in particular their variation and average,


- the effect of storage and processing of milk under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) on the freezing point.


Member States shall communicate to the Commission all details of the control system which they apply and its justification before 1 June 1994.


Heat-treated drinking milk may be subjected to any test which gives an indication of the microbiological condition of the milk before heat treatment. The rules for the application of such tests and the criteria to be met in this regard shall be established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 31 of this Directive.


4. (a) Pasteurized milk must:


(i) have been obtained by means of a treatment involving a high temperature for a short time (at least 71,7 oC for 15 seconds or any equivalent combination) or a pasteurization process using different time and temperature combinations to obtain an equivalent effect;


(ii) show a negative reaction to the phosphatase test and a positive reaction to the peroxidase test. However, the production of pasteurized milk which shows a negative reaction to the perioxidase test is authorized, provided that the milk is labelled as 'high-temperature pasteurized';


(iii) immediately after pasteurization, have been cooled to a temperature not exceeding 6 oC as soon as possible.


(b) UHT milk must:


- have been obtained by applying to the raw milk a continuous flow of heat entailing the application of a high temperature for a short time (not less than +135 oC for not less than a second) - the aim being to destroy all residual spoilage micro-organisms and their spores - using aseptic opaque containers, or containers made opaque by the packaging, but so that the chemical, physical and organoleptic changes are minimal,


- be of preservability such that no deterioration can be observed by means of random sampling checks after it has spent 15 days in a closed container at a temperature of +30 oC; where necessary, provision can also be made for a period of seven days in a closed container at a temperature of +55 oC.


Where the 'ultra high temperature' milk treatment process is employed by direct contact of milk and steam, the steam must be obtained from potable water and must not leave deposits of foreign matter in the milk or affect it adversely. Moreover, the use of this process must not cause any change in the water content of the treated milk.


(c) Sterilized milk must:


- have been heated and sterilized in hermetically sealed wrappings or containers, the seal of which must remain intact,


- in the event of random sampling, be of preservability such that no deterioration can be observed after it has spent 15 days in a closed container at a temperature of +30 oC; where necessary, provision can also be made for a period of seven days in a closed container at a temperature of +55 oC.


(d) Pasteurized milk which has been subjected to high-temperature pasteurization, UHT milk and sterilized milk may be produced from raw milk which has undergone thermization or an initial heat treatment in another establishment. In this case the time-temperature set must be lower than or equivalent to pasteurization and the milk must show a positive reaction to the peroxidase test before the second treatment. Recourse to this practice must be brought to the attention of the competent authority. Mention of the first treatment must be made on the document provided for in Article 5 (8) of this Directive.


(e) Heating processes, the temperatures and duration of heating in respect of pasteurized, UHT and sterilized milk, the types of heating equipment, the flow-diversion valve and the types of temperature controlling and recording devices shall be approved or authorized by the competent authority of the Member States in accordance with Community or international standards.


(f) The data produced by recording thermometers must be dated and kept for two years so that they can be shown upon request to the officials appointed by the competent authority to inspect the establishment, save in the case of microbiologically perishable products, for which this period may be reduced to two months after the use-by or minimum durability date.


5. Heat-treated drinking milk must:


(a) meet the microbiological standards laid down in Chapter II;


(b) not contain pharmacologically active substances in quantities higher than the limits laid down in Annexes I and III to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90; the combined total of residues of all antibiotic residues may not exceed a value to be fixed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90.


B. Requirements for milk for the manufacture of milk-based products


1. The operator or manager of the processing establishment must take all necessary steps to ensure that the raw milk is treated, or in the case of products 'made with raw milk' used, within 36 hours of acceptance, if the milk is kept at a temperature not exceeding 6 oC, or within 48 hours of acceptance if the milk is kept at a temperature of 4 oC or lower.


2. Heat-treated milk intended for the manufacture of milk-based products must be obtained from raw milk which complies with the standards laid down in Annex A, Chapter IV.

(ii) have been obtained by treatment as defined in Article 2 (6) of this Directive;


(iii) if it is used for the production of pasteurized, UHT or sterilized milk, meet the following standards before treatment: plate count at 30 oC equal to or less than 100 000 per ml;


(b) pasteurized milk must


(i) have been obtained by means of a treatment involving a high temperature for a short time (at least 71,7 oC for 15 seconds or any equivalent combination) or a pasteurization process using different time and temperature combinations to obtain an equivalent effect;


(ii) show a negative reaction to the phosphatase test and a positive reaction to the peroxidase test. However, the production of pasteurized milk which shows a negative reaction to the peroxidase test is authorized, provided that the milk is labelled as 'high-temperature pasteurized';


(c) UHT milk must have been obtained by applying to the raw milk a continuous flow of heat entailing the application of a high temperature for a short time (not less than +135 oC for not less than a second) - the aim being to destroy all residual spoilage micro-organisms and their spores - so that the chemical, physical and organoleptic changes are minimal.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 3458/92 of 30 November 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1014/90 laying down detailed implementing rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Havig regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 of 29 May 1989 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3280/92 (2), and in particular Article 1 (4) (i) (1) (b) thereof,


Whereas Article 1 (4) (i) (1) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 lays down the quantities of certain ingredients required if the names of certain fruit spirits are to be used; whereas Article 1 (4) (i) (1) (b) of that Regulation provides for derogations from the contents thus fixed under certain conditions;


Whereas Article 6 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1014/90 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1781/91 (4), thus sets the maximum methyl alcohol content of spirits obtained from certain fruits in small distilleries at 1 500 grams per hectolitre; whereas that maximum content applies until 31 December 1992 to obtained from pears in distilleries;


Whereas experience shows that the derogation should be maintained for all distilleries; whereas present techniques for producing the spirits in question mean that this measure should enable the final quality of the product and its traditional characteristics to be maintained; whereas, however, an in-depth evaluation of the various effects of the application of this measure should be conducted at the end of a trial period with a view to reducing the minimum methyl alcohol cntent as far as possible given, in particular, developments in techniques;


Whereas, however, it is possible to repeal the exception concerning the maximum methyl alcohol content of spirits contained fromarbutus in view of current regional techniques fro producing that spirituous beverage;


Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Implementation Committee for Spirit Drinks,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


Article 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1014/90 is hereby replaced by the following:

Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2),


Whereas an Agreement has been reached between the Republic of Austria and the European Economic Community on the transit of goods by road and rail (3);


Whereas Article 15 of the abovementioned Agreement provides for a reduction of pollution generated by heavy goods vehicles using Austrian territory in transit, which shall be achieved by cutting total NOx emissions of heavy goods vehicles with a laden weight of over 7,5 tonnes, by 60 % in the twelve year period of the agreement, namely until the end of 2003;


Whereas these total NOx emissions will be represented by a number of points (Ecopoints) to be used by vehicles in order to be allowed to transit through Austria;


Whereas the Agreement provides that the competent Austrian authorities will make available to the Community the abovementioned Ecopoints, which are to be distributed by the Community among its Member States in accordance with its own rules and procedures;


Whereas it is necessary to establish rules governing the distribution and management of the Ecopoints which are made available to the Community;


Whereas Ecopoints should be made available to the Member States by the Commission;

Council Directive 92/51/EEC of 18 June 1992 on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC




COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/51/EEC of 18 June 1992 on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, particular Articles 49, 57 (1) and 66 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


(1) Whereas, pursuant to Article 8a of the Treaty, the internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers and whereas, pursuant to Article 3 (c) of the Treaty, the abolition, as between Member States, of obstacles to freedom of movement for persons and services constitutes one of the objectives of the Community; whereas, for nationals of the Member States, this means in particular the possibility of pursuing a profession, whether in a self-employed or employed capacity, in a Member State other than that in which they acquired their professional qualifications;


(2) Whereas, for those professions for the pursuit of which the Community has not laid down the necessary minimum level of qualification, Member States reserve the option of fixing such a level with a view to guaranteeing the quality of services provided in their territory; whereas, however, they may not, without disregarding their obligations laid down in Articles 5, 48, 52 and 59 of the Treaty, require a national of a Member State to obtain those qualifications which in general they determine only by reference to those issued under their own national education and training systems, where the person concerned has already acquired all or part of those qualifications in another Member State; whereas, as a result, any host Member State in which a profession is regulated is required to take account of qualifications acquired in another Member State and to determine whether those qualifications correspond to the qualifications which the Member State concerned requires;


(3) Whereas Council Directive 89/48/EEC of 21 December 1988 on a general system for the recognition of higher education diplomas awarded on completion of professional education and training of at least three years' duration (4) facilitates compliance with such obligations; whereas, however, it is limited to higher education;


(4) Whereas, in order to facilitate the pursuit of all those professional activities which in a host Member State are dependent on the completion of a certain level of education and training, a second general system should be introduced to complement the first;


(5) Whereas the complementary general system must be based on the same principles and contain mutatis mutandis the same rules as the initial general system;


(6) Whereas this Directive is not applicable to those regulated professions which are covered by specific Directives principally concerned with introducing mutual recognition of training courses completed before entry into professional life;


(7) Whereas neither is it applicable, furthermore, to those activities covered by specific Directives principally intended to introduce recognition of technical skills based on experience acquired in another Member State; whereas certain of those Directives apply solely to the pursuit of activities in a self-employed capacity; whereas, in order to ensure that the pursuit of such activities as an employed person does not fall within the scope of this Directive, whereby the pursuit of the same activity would be subject to different legal recognition arrangements depending on whether it was pursued in a self-employed capacity or as an employed person, those Directives should be made applicable to persons pursuing the activities in question as employed persons;


(8) Whereas the complementary general system is entirely without prejudice to the application of Article 48 (4) and Article 55 of the Treaty;


(9) Whereas this complementary system must cover the levels of education and training not covered by the initial general system, namely that corresponding to other post-secondary education and training courses and other equivalent education and training, and that corresponding to long or short secondary courses, possibly complemented by professional training or experience;


(10) Whereas, where in most Member States pursuit of a given regulated profession is subject to either very short training or the possession of certain personal attributes or merely general knowledge, the normal mechanisms for recognition under this Directive may be excessively cumbersome; whereas in such cases there should be provision for simplified mechanisms;


(11) Whereas account should also be taken of the professional training system in the United Kingdom whereby standards for levels of performance for all professional activities are established via the 'National Framework of Vocational Qualifications';


(12) Whereas in some Member States there are only relatively few regulated professions; whereas, however, training for professions which are not regulated may be specifically geared to the pursuit of the profession, with the structure and level of training being monitored or approved by the competent authorities of the Member State concerned; whereas this provides guarantees equivalent to those provided in connection with a regulated profession;


(13) Whereas the competent authorities of the host Member State should be allowed to determine, in accordance with the relevant provisions of Community law, the detailed rules necessary for implementation of the adaptation period and the aptitude test;


(14) Whereas, since it covers two levels of education and training and since the initial general system covers a third level, the complementary general system must lay down whether and under what conditions a person possessing a certain level of education and training may pursue, in another Member State, a profession the qualifications for which are regulated at a different level;


(15) Whereas, for the pursuit of certain professions, certain Member States require the possession of a diploma within the meaning of Directive 89/48/EEC, while for the same profession other Member States require the completion of professional education or training with a different structure; whereas certain kinds of education and training, while not of a post-secondary nature of minimum duration within the meaning of this Directive, nevertheless result in a comparable professional level and prepare the person for similar responsibilities and activities; whereas such education and training should therefore be classed in the same category as that attested by a diploma; whereas such education and training is very varied and this classification can be achieved only by listing the courses in question; whereas such classification would, where appropriate, establish the recognition of equivalence between such education and training and that covered by Directive 89/48/EEC; whereas some regulated education and training should also be classed at diploma level in a second list;


(16) Whereas, in view of the constantly changing organization of professional training, there should be a procedure for amending those lists;


(17) Whereas, since it covers occupations the pursuit of which is dependent on the possession of professional or vocational education and training qualifications of secondary level and generally requires manual skills, the complementary general system must also provide for the recognition of such qualifications even where they have been acquired solely through professional experience in a Member State which does not regulate such professions;


(18) Whereas the aim of this general system, like the first general system, is to eliminate obstacles to the taking up and pursuit of regulated professions; whereas work carried out pursuant to Council Decision 85/368/EEC of 16 July 1985 on the comparability of vocational training qualifications between the Member States of the European Community (5), while pursuing a different objective from the elimination of legal obstacles to freedom of movement, namely that of improving the transparency of the labour market, must be used, where appropriate, in the application of this Directive, particularly where it could provide information on the subject, content and duration of professional training;


(19) Whereas professional bodies and professional educational and training establishments should, where appropriate, be consulted or be involved in an appropriate way in the decision-making process;


(20) Whereas, like the initial system, such a system, by strengthening the right of a Community national to use his occupational skills in any Member State, supplements and reinforces his right to acquire such skills wherever he wishes;


(21) Whereas the two systems should be evaluated, after a certain period of application, in order to determine how efficiently they operate and, in particular, how they can both be improved,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


CHAPTER I

Article 1


For the purposes of this Directive, the following definitions shall apply:


(a) diploma: any evidence of education and training or any set of such evidence:

provided that the education and training attested by this evidence was received mainly in the Community, or outside the Community at teaching establishments which provide education and training in accordance with the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of a Member State, or that the holder thereof has two years' professional experience certified by the Member State which recognized third-country evidence of education and training.


The following shall be treated in the same was as a certificate, within the meaning of the first subparagraph: any evidence of education and training or any set of such evidence awarded by a competent authority in a Member State if it is awarded on the successful completion of education and training received in the Community and recognized by a competent authority in a Member State as being of an equivalent level and if it confers the same rights in respect of the taking up and pursuit of a regulated profession in that Member State;


(c) attestation of competence: any evidence of qualifications:


- attesting to education and training not forming part of a set constituting a diploma within the meaning of Directive 89/48/EEC or a diploma or certificate within the meaning of this Directive, or


- awarded following an assessment of the personal qualities, aptitudes or knowledge which it is considered essential that the applicant have for the pursuit of a profession by an authority designated in accordance with the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of a Member State, without proof of prior education and training being required;


(d) host Member State: any Member State in which a national of a Member State applies to pursue a profession subject to regulation in that Member State, other than the State in which he obtained his evidence of education and training or attestation of competence or first pursued the profession in question;


(e) regulated profession: the regulated professional activity or range of activities which constitute this profession in a Member State;


(f) regulated professional activity: a professional activity the taking up or pursuit of which, or one of its modes of pursuit in a Member State, is subject, directly or indirectly, by virtue of laws, regulations or administrative provisions, to the possession of evidence of education and training or an attestation of competence. The following in particular shall constitute a mode of pursuit of a regulated professional activity:


- pursuit of an activity under a professional title, in so far as the use of such a title is reserved to the holders of evidence of education and training or an attestation of competence governed by laws, regulations or administrative provisions,


- pursuit of a professional activity relating to health, in so far as remuneration and/or reimbursement for such an activity is subject by virtue of national social security arrangements to the possession of evidence of education and training or an attestation of competence.


Where the first subparagraph does not apply, a professional activity shall be deemed to be a regulated professional activity if it is pursued by the members of an association or organization the purpose of which is, in particular, to promote and maintain a high standard in the professional field concerned and which, to achieve that purpose, is recognized in a special form by a Member State and:


- awards evidence of education and training to its members,


- ensures that its members respect the rules of professional conduct which it prescribes, and


- confers on them the right to use a professional title or designatory letters, or to benefit from a status corresponding to that education and training.


Whenever a Member State grants the recognition referred to in the second subparagraph to an association or organization which satisfies the conditions of that subparagraph, it shall inform the Commission thereof;


(g) regulated education and training: any education and training which:


- is specifically geared to the pursuit of a given profession, and


- comprises a course or courses complemented, where appropriate, by professional training or probationary or professional practice, the structure and level of which are determined by the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of that Member State or which are monitored or approved by the authority designated for that purpose;


(h) professional experience: the actual and lawful pursuit of the profession concerned in a Member State;


(i) adaptation period: the pursuit of a regulated profession in the host Member State under the responsibility of a qualified member of that profession, such period of supervised practice possibly being accompanied by further education and training.

The status enjoyed in the host Member State by the person undergoing the period of supervised practice, in particular in the matter of right of residence as well as of obligations, social rights and benefits, allowances and remuneration, shall be established by the competent authorities in that Member State in accordance with applicable Community law;


(j) aptitude test: a test limited to the professional knowledge of the applicant, made by the competent authorities of the host Member State with the aim of assessing the ability of the applicant to pursue a regulated profession in that Member State.


In order to permit this test to be carried out, the competent authorities shall draw up a list of subjects which, on the basis of a comparison of the education and training required in the Member State and that received by the applicant, are not


covered by the evidence of education and training possessed by the applicant. These subjects may cover both theoretical knowledge and practical skills required for the pursuit of the profession.


This aptitude test must take account of the fact that the applicant is a qualified professional in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which he comes. It shall cover subjects to be selected from those on the list referred to in the second subparagraph, knowledge of which is essential to the pursuit of the profession in the host Member State. The test may also include knowledge of the professional rules applicable to the activities in question in the host Member State. The detailed application of the aptitude test shall be determined by the competent authorities of that State.


The status in the host Member State of the applicant who wishes to prepare himself for the aptitude test in that State shall be determined by the competent authorities in that State, in accordance with applicable Community law.


CHAPTER II


Scope


Article 2


This Directive shall apply to any national of a Member State wishing to pursue a regulated profession in a host Member State in a self-employed capacity or as an employed person.


This Directive shall apply to neither professions which are the subject of a specific Directive establishing arrangements for the mutual recognition of diplomas by Member States, nor activities covered by a Directive listed in Annex A.


The Directives listed in Annex B shall be made applicable to the pursuit as an employed person of the activities covered by those Directives.


CHAPTER III


System for recognition where a host Member State requires possession of a diploma within the meaning of this Directive or Directive 89/48/EEC


Article 3


Without prejudice to Directive 89/48/EEC, where, in a host Member State, the taking up or pursuit of a regulated profession is subject to possession of a diploma, as defined in this Directive or in Directive 89/48/EEC, the competent authority may not, on the grounds of inadequate qualifications, refuse to authorize a national of a Member State to take up or pursue that profession on the same conditions as those which apply to its own nationals:


(a) if the applicant holds the diploma, as defined in this Directive or in Directive 89/48/EEC, required in another Member State for the taking up or pursuit of the profession in question in its territory, such diploma having been awarded in a Member State; or


(b) if the applicant has pursued the profession in question full-time for two years, or for an equivalent period on a part-time basis, during the previous 10 years in another Member State which does not regulate that profession within the meaning of either Article 1 (e) and the first subparagraph of Article 1 (f) of this Directive or Article 1 (c) and the first subparagraph of Article 1 (d) of Directive 89/48/EEC, and possesses evidence of education and training which:


- has been awarded by a competent authority in a Member State, designated in accordance with the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of that State, and


- either shows that the holder has successfully completed a post-secondary course, other than that referred to in the second indent of Article 1 (a) of Directive 89/48/EEC, of at least one year's duration, or of equivalent duration on a part-time basis, one of the conditions of entry of which is, as a general rule, the successful completion of the secondary course required to obtain entry to university or higher education, as well as any professional training which is an integral part of that post-secondary course,


- or attests to regulated education and training referred to in Annex D, and


- has prepared the holder for the pursuit of his profession.


However, the two years' professional experience referred to above may not be required where the evidence of education and training held by the applicant and referred to in this point is awarded on completion of regulated education and training.


The following shall be treated in the same way as the evidence of education and training referred to in the first subparagraph of this point: any evidence of education and training or any set of such evidence awarded by a competent authority in a Member State if it is awarded on the completion of education and training received in the Community and is recognized by that Member State as being of an equivalent level, provided that the other Member States and the Commission have been notified of this recognition.


By way of derogation from the first subparagraph of this Article, the host Member State is not required to apply this Article where the taking up or pursuit of a regulated profession is subject in its country to possession of a diploma as defined in Directive 89/48/EEC, one of the conditions for the issue of which shall be the completion of a post-secondary course of more than four years duration.


Article 4


1. Notwithstanding Article 3, the host Member State may also require the applicant:


(a) to provide evidence of professional experience, where the duration of the education and training adduced in support of his application, as laid down in points (a) and (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 3, is at least one year less than that required in the host Member State. In this event, the period of professional experience required may not exceed:


- twice the shortfall in duration of education and training where the shortfall relates to a post-secondary course and/or to a period of probationary practice carried out under the control of a supervising professional person and ending with an examination,


- the shortfall where the shortfall relates to professional practice acquired with the assistance of a qualified member of the profession concerned.


In the case of diplomas within the meaning of the second subparagraph of Article 1 (a), the duration of education and training recognized as being of an equivalent level shall be determined as for the education and training defined in the first subparagraph of Article 1 (a).


When these provisions are applied, account must be taken of the professional experience referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 3.


In any event, the professional experience required may not exceed four years.


Professional experience may not, however, be required of an applicant holding a diploma attesting to a post-secondary course as referred to in the second indent of Article 1 (a) or a diploma as defined in Article 1 (a) of Directive 89/48/EEC who wishes to pursue his profession in a host Member State which requires the possession of a diploma or evidence of education and training attesting to one of the courses of education and training as referred to in Annexes C and D;


(b) to complete an adaptation period not exceeding three years or take an aptitude test where:


- the theoretical and/or practical matters covered by the education and training which he has received as laid down in points (a) or (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 3 differ substantially from those covered by the diploma, as defined in this Directive or in Directive 89/48/EEC, required in the host Member State, or


- in the case referred to in point (a) of the first subparagraph of Article 3, the profession regulated in the host Member State comprises one or more regulated professional activities which do not form part of the profession regulated in the Member State from which the applicant originates or comes and that difference corresponds to specific education and training required in the host Member State and covers theoretical and/or practical matters which differ substantially from those covered by the diploma, as defined in this Directive or in Directive 89/48/EEC, adduced by the applicant, or


- in the case referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 3, the profession regulated in the host Member State comprises one or more regulated professional activities which do not form part of the profession pursued by the applicant in the Member State from which he originates or comes, and that difference corresponds to specific education and training required in the host Member State and covers theoretical and/or practical matters which differ substantially from those covered by the evidence of education and training adduced by the applicant.


Should the host Member State make use of this possibility, it must give the applicant the right to choose between an adaptation period and an aptitude test. Where the host Member State, which requires a diploma as defined in Directive 89/48/EEC or in this Directive, intends to introduce derogations from an applicant's right to choose, the procedure laid down in Article 14 shall apply.


By way of derogation from the second subparagraph of this point, the host Member State may reserve the right to choose between the adaptation period and the aptitude test if


- a profession is involved the pursuit of which requires a precise knowledge of national law and in respect of which the provision of advice and/or assistance concerning national law is an essential and constant feature of the professional activity, or


- where the host Member State makes access to the profession or its pursuit subject to the possession of a diploma as defined in Directive 89/48/EEC, one of the conditions for the award of which is the completion of a post-secondary course of at least three years' duration or an equivalent period on a part-time basis and the applicant holds either a diploma as defined in this Directive or evidence of education and training within the meaning of point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 3 and not covered by Article 3 (b) of Directive 89/48/EEC.


2. However, the host Member State may not apply the provisions of paragraph 1 (a) and (b) cumulatively.


CHAPTER IV


System for recognition where a host Member State requires possession of a diploma and the applicant is the holder of a certificate or has received corresponding education and training


Article 5


Where, in a host Member State, the taking up or pursuit of a regulated profession is subject to possession of a diploma, the competent authority may not, on the grounds of inadequate qualifications, refuse to authorize a national of a Member State to take up or pursue that profession on the same conditions as those which apply to its own nationals:


(a) if the applicant holds the certificate required in another Member State for the taking up or pursuit of the same profession in its territory, such certificate having been awarded in a Member State; or


(b) if the applicant has pursued the same profession full-time for two years during the previous 10 years in another Member State which does not regulate that profession, within the meaning of Article 1 (e) and the first subparagraph of Article 1 (f), and possesses evidence of education and training:


- which was been awarded by a competent authority in a Member State, designated in accordance with the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of that State, and


- which shows that the holder, after having followed a secondary course, has completed:


either a course of professional education or training other than courses referred to in point (a), provided at an educational or training establishment or on the job, or in combination at an educational or training establishment and on the job and complemented, where appropriate, by the probationary or professional practice which is an integral part of that training course,


or the probationary or professional practice which is an integral part of that secondary course, or


- which shows that the holder, after having followed a secondary course of a technical or vocational nature has completed, where necessary,


either a course of professional education or training as referred to in the previous indent,


or the period of probationary or professional practice which is an integral part of that secondary course of a technical or vocational nature and


- which has prepared the holder for the pursuit of this profession.


However, the two years' professional experience referred to above may not be required where the evidence of education and training held by the applicant and referred to in this point is awarded on completion of regulated education and training.


Nevertheless, the host Member State may require the applicant to undergo an adaptation period not exceeding three years or take an aptitude test. The host Member State must give the applicant the right to choose between an adaptation period and an aptitude test.


Where the host Member State intends to introduce derogations from an applicant's right to choose, the procedure laid down in Article 14 shall apply.


CHAPTER V


System for recognition where a host Member State requires possession of a certificate


Article 6


Where, in the host Member State, the taking up or pursuit of a regulated profession is subject to possession of a certificate, the competent authority may not, on the grounds of inadequate qualifications, refuse to authorize a national of a Member State to take up or pursue that profession on the same conditions as those which apply to its own nationals:


(a) if the applicant holds the diploma, as defined in this Directive or in Directive 89/48/EEC, or the certificate required in another Member State for the taking up or pursuit of the profession in question in its territory, such diploma having been awarded in a Member State; or


(b) if the applicant has pursued the profession in question full-time for two years or for an equivalent period on a part-time basis during the previous 10 years in another Member State which does not regulate that profession, within the meaning of


Article 1


(e) and the first subparagraph of Article 1 (f), and possesses evidence of education and training:


- which has been awarded by a competent authority in a Member State, designated in accordance with the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of that State, and


- which shows that the holder has successfully completed a post-secondary course other than that referred to in the second indent of Article 1 (a) of Directive 89/48/EEC, of at least one year's duration or of equivalent duration on a part-time basis, one of the conditions of entry of which is, as a general rule, the completion of the secondary course required to obtain entry to university or higher education, as well as any professional training which is an integral part of that post-secondary course, or


- which shows that the holder, after having followed a secondary course, has completed:


either a course of education or training for a profession other than courses referred to in point (a), provided at an educational establishment or on the job, or in combination at an educational establishment and on the job and complemented, where appropriate, by the probationary or professional practice which is an integral part of that training course,


or the probationary or professional practice which is an integral part of that secondary course, or


- which shows that the holder, after having followed a secondary course of a technical or vocational nature has completed, where necessary,


either a course of education or training for a profession as referred to in the previous indent,


or the period of probationary or professional practice which is an integral part of that secondary course of a technical or vocational nature and


- which has prepared the holder for the pursuit of this profession.


However, the two years' professional experience referred to above may not be required where the evidence of education and training held by the applicant and referred to in this point is awarded on completion or regulated education and training.


(c) if the applicant who does not hold any diploma, certificate or other evidence of education and training within the meaning of Article 3 (b) or of point (b) of this Article has pursued the profession in question full-time for three consecutive years, or for an equivalent period on a part-time basis, during the previous 10 years in another Member State which does not regulate that profession within the meaning of Article 1 (e) and the first subparagraph of Article 1 (f).


The following shall be treated in the same way as the evidence of education and training referred to under (b) in the first subparagraph: any evidence of education and training or any set of such evidence awarded by a competent authority in a Member State if it is awarded on the completion of education and training received in the Community and is recognized by that Member State as being of an equivalent level, provided that the other Member States and the Commission have been notified of this recognition.


Article 7


Without prejudice to Article 6, a host Member State may also require the applicant to:


(a) complete an adaptation period not exceeding two years or to take an aptitude test when the education and training which he received in accordance with points (a) or (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 5 relates to theoretical or practical matters differing substantially from those covered by the certificate required in the host Member State, or where there are differences in the fields of activity characterized in the host Member State by specific education and training relating to theoretical or practical matters differing substantially from those covered by the applicant's evidence of formal qualifications.


Should the host Member State make use of this possibility, it must give the applicant the right to choose between an adaptation period and an aptitude test. Where the host Member State which requires a certificate intends to introduce derogations as regards an applicant's right to choose, the procedure laid down in Article 14 shall apply;


(b) undergo an adaptation period not exceeding two years or take an aptitude test where, in the instance referred to in point (c) of the first subparagraph of Article 6, he does not hold a diploma, certificate or other evidence of education and training. The host Member State may reserve the right to choose between an adaptation period and an aptitude test.


CHAPTER VI


Special systems for recognition of other qualifications


Article 8


Where, in the host Member State, the taking up or pursuit of a regulated profession is subject to possession of


an attestation of competence, the competent authority may not, on the grounds of inadequate qualifications, refuse to authorize a national of a Member State to take up or pursue that profession on the same conditions as those which apply to its own nationals:


(a) if the applicant holds the attestation of competence required in another Member State for the taking up or pursuit of the same profession in its territory, such attestation having been awarded in a Member State; or


(b) if the applicant provides proof of qualifications obtained in other Member States,


and giving guarantees, in particular in the matter of health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection, equivalent to those required by the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the host Member State.


If the applicant does not provide proof of such an attestation or of such qualifications the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the host Member State shall apply.


Article 9


Where, in the host Member State, the taking up or pursuit of a regulated profession is subject only to possession of evidence of education attesting to general education at primary or secondary school level, the competent authority may not, on the grounds of inadequate qualifications, refuse to authorize a national of a Member State to take up or pursue that profession on the same conditions as those which apply to its own nationals if the applicant possesses formal qualifications of the corresponding level, awarded in another Member State.


This evidence of formal qualifications must have been awarded by a competent authority in that Member State, designated in accordance with its own laws, regulations or administrative provisions.


CHAPTER VII


Other measures to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment, freedom to provide services and freedom of movement of employed persons


Article 10


1. Where the competent authority of the host Member State requires of persons wishing to take up a regulated profession proof that they are of good character or repute or that they have not been declared bankrupt, or suspends or prohibits the pursuit of that profession in the event of serious professional misconduct or a criminal offence, that State shall accept as sufficient evidence, in respect of nationals of Member States wishing to pursue that profession in its territory, the production of documents issued by competent authorities in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes showing that those requirements are met.


Where the competent authorities of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which the foreign national comes do not issue the documents referred to in the first subparagraph, such documents shall be replaced by a declaration on oath - or, in Member States where there is no provision for declaration on oath, by a solemn declaration - made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority or, where appropriate, a notary or qualified professional body of the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the person comes; such authority or notary shall issue written confirmation attesting the authenticity of the declaration on oath or solemn declaration.


2. Where the competent authority of the host Member State requires of nationals of that Member State wishing to take up or pursue a regulated profession a statement of physical of mental health, that authority shall accept as sufficient evidence in this respect the production of the document required in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes.


Where the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes does not impose any requirements of this nature on those wishing to take up or pursue the profession in question, the host Member State shall accept from such nationals a statement issued by a competent authority in that State corresponding to the statement issued in the host Member State.


3. The competent authority of the host Member State may require that the documents and statements referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 are presented no more than three months after their date of issue.


4. Where the competent authority of the host Member State requires nationals of that Member State wishing to take up or pursue a regulated profession to take an oath or make solemn declaration and where the form of such oath or declaration cannot be used by nationals of other Member States, that authority shall ensure that an appropriate and equivalent form of oath or declaration is offered to the person concerned.


Article 11


1. The competent authorities of host Member States shall recognize the right of nationals of Member States who fulfil the conditions for the taking up and pursuit


of a regulated profession in their territory to use the professional title of the host Member State corresponding to that profession.


2. The competent authority of the host Member State shall recognize the right of nationals of Member States who fulfil the conditions for the taking up and pursuit of a regulated profession in the territory to use their lawful academic title and, where appropriate, the abbreviation thereof deriving from their Member State of origin or the Member State from which they come, in the language of that State. The host Member State may require this title to be followed by the name and location of the establishment or examining board which awarded it.


3. Where a profession is regulated in the host Member State by an association or organization referred to in Article 1 (f), nationals of Member States shall be entitled to use the professional title or designatory letters conferred by that organization or association only on proof of membership.


Where the association or organization makes membership subject to certain qualification requirements, it may apply these to nationals of other Member States who are in possession of a diploma within the meaning of Article 1 (a), a certificate within the meaning of Article 1 (b) or evidence of education and training or qualification within the meaning of point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 3, point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 5 or Article 9 in accordance only with this Directive, in particular Articles 3, 4 and 5.


Article 12


1. The host Member State shall accept as means of proof that the conditions laid down in Articles 3 to 9 are satisfied the documents issued by the competent authorities in the Member States, which the person concerned shall submit in support of his application to pursue the profession concerned.


2. The procedure for examining an application to pursue a regulated profession shall be completed as soon as possible and the outcome communicated in a reasoned decision of the competent authority in the host Member State not later than four months after presentation of all the documents relating to the person concerned. A remedy shall be available against this decision or the absence thereof, before a court or tribunal in accordance with the provisions of national law.


CHAPTER VIII


Procedure for coordination


Article 13


1. Member States shall designate, within the period provided for in Article 17, the competent authorities empowered to receive the applications and take the decisions referred to in this Directive. They shall communicate this information to the other Member States and to the Commission.


2. Each Member State shall designate a person responsible for coordinating the activities of the authorities referred to in paragraph 1 and shall inform the other Member States and the Commission to that effect. His role shall be to promote uniform application of this Directive to all the professions concerned. This coordinator shall be a member of the coordinating group set up under the aegis of the Commission by Article 9 (2) of Directive 89/48/EEC.


The coordinating group set up under the aforementioned provision of Directive 89/48/EEC shall also be required to:


- facilitate the implementation of this Directive,


- collect all useful information for its application in the Member States, particularly information relating to the establishment of an indicative list of regulated professions and to the disparities between the qualifications awarded in the Member States with a view to assisting the competent authorities of the Member States in their task of assessing whether substantial differences exist.


The group may be consulted by the Commission on any changes to the existing system which may be contemplated.


3. The Member States shall take measures to provide the necessary information on the recognition of diplomas and certificates and on other conditions governing the taking up of the regulated professions within the framework of this Directive. To carry out this task they may call upon the existing information networks and, where appropriate, the relevant professional associations or organizations. The Commission shall take the necessary initiatives to ensure the development and coordination of the communication of the necessary information.


CHAPTER IX


Procedure for derogating from the right to choose between adaptation period and aptitude test


Article 14


1.

Council Regulation (EEC) No 1247/92 of 30 April 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self- employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community




COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1247/92 of 30 April 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 51 and 235 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, drawn up after consulting the Administrative Commission on Social Security for Migrant Workers(1) ,


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2) ,


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3) ,


Whereas it is necessary to amend Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71(4) , as updated by Regulation (EEC) No 2001/83(5) , as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2195/91(6) ;


Whereas it is necessary to extend the definition of 'member of the family' in Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 to conform with the case law of the Court of Justice concerning the interpretation of that expression;


Whereas it is also necessary to take account of the case law of the Court of Justice stating that certain benefits provided under national laws may fall simultaneously within the categories of both social security and social assistance because of the class of persons to whom such laws apply, their objectives and their manner of application;


Whereas the Court of Justice has stated that, in some of its features, legislation under which such benefits are granted is akin to social assistance in that need is an essential criterion in its implementation and the conditions of entitlement are not based upon the aggregation of periods of employment or contributions, whilst in other features it is close to social security to the extent that there is an absence of discretion in the manner in which such benefits as are provided thereunder are awarded and in that it confers a legally defined position upon beneficiaries;


Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 excludes from its scope, by virtue of Article 4 (4) thereof, social assistance schemes;


Whereas the conditions referred to and their methods of application are such that a system of coordination which differs from that currently provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and which takes account of the special characteristics of the benefits concerned should be included in that Regulation in order to protect the interests of migrant workers in accordance with the provisions of Article 51 of the Treaty;


Whereas such benefits should be granted, in respect of persons falling within the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71, solely in accordance with the legislation of the country of residence of the person concerned or of the members of his or her family, with such aggregation of periods of residence completed in any other Member State as is necessary and without discrimination on grounds of nationality;


Whereas it is necessary nevertheless to ensure that the existing system of coordination in Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 continues to apply to benefits which either do not fall within the special category of benefits referred to or are not expressly included in an Annex to that Regulation; whereas a new Annex is needed for this purpose,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 is hereby amended as follows:


1. In Article 1:


(a) point (f) shall become point (f) (i), and the following shall be inserted as point (f) (ii):

(a) either to provide supplementary, substitute or ancillary cover against the risks covered by the branches of social security referred to in paragraph 1 (a) to (h), or


(b) solely as specific protection for the disabled.


2b. This Regulation shall not apply to the provisions in the legislation of a Member State concerning special non-contributory benefits, referred to in Annex II, Section III, the validity of which is confined to part of its territory.';

Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 10 and Title III, persons to whom this Regulation applies shall be granted the special non-contributory cash benefits referred to in Article 4 (2a) exclusively in the territory of the Member State in which they reside, in accordance with the legislation of that State, provided that such benefits are listed in Annex IIa. Such benefits shall be granted by and at the expense of the institution of the place of residence.


2. The institution of a Member State under whose legislation entitlement to benefits covered by paragraph 1 is subject to the completion of periods of employment, self-employment or residence shall regard, to the extent necessary, periods of employment, self-employment or residence completed in the territory of any other Member State as periods completed in the territory of the first Member State.


3. Where entitlement to a benefit covered by paragraph 1 but granted in the form of a supplement is subject, under the legislation of a Member State, to receipt of a benefit covered by Article 4 (1) (a) to (h), and no such benefit is due under that legislation, any corresponding benefit granted under the legislation of any other Member State shall treated as a benefit granted under the legislation of the first Member State for the purposes of entitlement to the supplement.


4. Where the granting of a disability or invalidity benefit covered by paragraph 1 is subject, under the legislation of a Member State, to the condition that the disability or invalidity should be diagnosed for the first time in the territory of that Member State, this condition shall be deemed to be fulfilled where such diagnosis is made for the first time in the territory of another Member State.';

92/143/EEC: Council Decision of 25 February 1992 on radionavigation systems for Europe




COUNCIL DECISION of 25 February 1992 on radionavigation systems for Europe (92/143/EEC)


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 84 (2) thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas the 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (Solas 1974) drafted under the auspices of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), requires contracting parties to arrange for the establishment and maintenance of such aids to navigation as the volume of traffic and the degree of risk warrant;


Whereas, in its Resolution A.666 (16), the IMO refers both to the need for a worldwide radionavigation system and to the possibility of regional applications of terrestrial systems such as Chayka, Decca Navigator, Loran-C, Omega and Differential Omega;


Whereas the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities confirms that, in order to meet the needs of maritime navigation, a terrestrial radionavigation system is necessary until general-purpose satellite systems are widely available, and also thereafter in parallel to such systems for the foreseeable future;


Whereas it is a concern of the Community to ensure the highest degree of safety of navigation and protection of the marine environment;


Whereas the United States Coastguard has decided to terminate its Loran-C commitments outside the United States of America as from 1994 and intends to offer the Loran-C facilities to the relevant host nations;


Whereas certain Member States intend to participate in one or more regional agreements on the establishment of Loran-C chains covering North-West Europe and the North Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the Iberian Peninsula and the Baltic, while a number of these areas are already covered by terrestrial systems, such as Decca and Omega;


Whereas Member States are not required to abandon existing radionavigation systems, such as Decca and Omega, provided they fulfil their Loran-C obligations in accordance with regional agreements;


Whereas the Loran-C system in particular satisfies international requirements and its more general application does not prejudice the development of satellite aids to navigation, especially as combined coverage by satellite and Loran-C will offer an excellent degree of system verification and continuity of radionavigation coverage for the benefit of maritime safety and environmental protection;


Whereas the establishment of regional Loran-C systems must ensure coherent and complete coverage of the European maritime area, avoiding as much as possible the imposition of additional costs upon the users of existing terrestrial radionavigation systems,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:


Article 1


1. Without prejudice to existing radionavigation systems, Member States which participate in or join regional agreements on Loran-C shall do so in a way which fulfils international objectives.


2. With regard to their participation in the regional agreements referred to in paragraph 1, Member States shall seek to achieve the radionavigation configurations which cover the widest possible geographical area in Europe and in neighbouring waters.


Article 2


The Commission shall:


- ensure coordination between the Member States participating in the regional agreements referred to in paragraph 1 with a view to ensuring compatibility between the Loran-C chains introduced at regional level,


- encourage the development of receivers, which take account of the ongoing development of satellite systems and the enhancement of the present Loran-C system,


- pursue its work with a view to setting up a radionavigation plan which takes into account the development of satellite navigation systems, of existing terrestrial systems and of the radionavigation plans of the Member States, and


- propose the necessary measures to the Council should the need arise.


Article 3


As members or observers within the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities, Member States and the Commission shall support efforts to set up a worldwide radionavigation system including European regional Loran-C chains with the purpose of enlarging worldwide Loran-C coverage in order to improve the safety of navigation and protection of the marine environment.

Whereas on 19 July 1991 the Commission adopted Decision 91/398/EEC on a computerized network linking veterinary authorities (Animo) (3) and on 2 July 1992 Decision 92/373/EEC designating the host centre Animo (4);

THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas, in view of trends, in the olive-oil market and in its relations with other vegetable-oil markets, the representative market price and the threshold price should be fixed at the same time as the other official olive-oil prices; whereas, for this reason, the criteria for fixing the representative market price should also be adapted;


Whereas in order to ensure that the greatest number of producers are guaranteed intervention prices, access to Community intervention should be permitted to producer groups and associations thereof recognized under Regulation (EEC) No 136/66/EEC (4);


Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 136/66/EEC should therefore be amended,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


Regulation No 136/66/EEC is hereby amended as follows:


1. in Article 4 (1), the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:


'A production target price, an intervention price, a representative market price and a threshold price shall be fixed each year for the Community for olive oil.';


2. Article 4 (4) shall be replaced by the following:


'4. The prices referred to in paragraph 1 (a) and the standard quality referred to in paragraph 2 shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty.';


3. in Article 5 (1) the second subparagraph is replaced by the following:


'Each year the Council shall fix the unit amount of production aid in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty. A separate unit amount may be fixed for producers whose average production is less than 500 kg of olive oil per marketing year.';


4. Article 7 is replaced by the following:


'Article 7


The representative market price shall be fixed at a level permitting the normal disposal of olive-oil production, having regard, in particular, to the outlook for trends on the vegetable oils and fats market.';


5. Article 11 (6) is replaced by the following:


'6. The Council, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, shall fix, at the same time as the representative market price, the percentage of consumption aid referred to in paragraph 5 and the percentage of consumption aid to be used for information measures and any other measures intended to promote the consumption of olive oil produced in the Community.';


6. The first paragraph of Article 12 (1) shall be replaced by the following:


'The intervention agencies designated by the producer Member States shall buy in during the month of July, August, September and October of each marketing year, in accordance with the rules adopted under paragraph 4, olive oil of Community origin which is offered to them by producers or producer groups and associations thereof recognized pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 1360/78 (or producer organizations and/or associations thereof recognized pursuant to the Regulation), at intervention centres in production areas. The intervention agencies shall buy in at the intervention price. The buying-in price shall be adjusted by means of a scale of price increases and reductions where the description or quality of the oil offered to the intervention agency does not correspond to that for which the intervention price was fixed.'


Article 2


This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Comunities.

COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 92/90/EEC of 3 November 1992 establishing obligations to which producers and importers of plants, plant products or other objects are subject and establishing details for their registration


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Directive 77/93/EEC of 21 December 1976 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1), as last amended by Commission Directive 92/10/EEC (2), and in particular Article 6 (7), fourth indent, and Article 6 (8),


Whereas the application of the Community plant health regime to the Community as an area without internal frontiers, will require the carrying out of plant health checks of Community products of plant health concern before their movement within the Community; whereas the most appropriate place for carrying out these checks is the place of production of producers listed in an official register;


Whereas, with a view to the production of plants, plant products or other objects which are not infested or infected by harmful organisms referred to in Council Directive 77/93/EEC, and adequate monitoring by Member States of that production, it is necessary to establish more rules on the listing of producers or other persons for which the listing in an official register is required, as well as certain detailed and - to that extent - uniform obligations to which producers of plants, plant products or other objects should be subject;


Whereas the measures provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


Article 1


1. Member States shall ensure that any producer, collective warehouse, dispatching centre, other person or importer who come under Article 6 (4), third subparagraph, Article 6 (5), Article 10 (3), second indent or Article 12 (6), second subparagraph, of Directive 77/93/EEC respectively, shall enter an application for listing in an official register, through an appropriate registration procedure, to the responsible official bodies referred to in Directive 77/93/EEC.


2. Member States shall ensure that on receipt of the application referred to in paragraph 1, the said responsible official bodies shall record this application in an official register of applications and shall examine the information supplied in the application form.


3.

(b) to keep records, with a view to having complete information available for the said responsible official bodies, on plants, plant products or other objects,


- purchased for storage or planting on the premises,


- under production, or


- dispatched to others,


and to keep related documents for at least one year;


(c) to be available personally or to designate another person technically experienced in plant production and related plant health matters, to liaise with the said responsible official bodies;

Council Directive 92/57/EEC of 24 June 1992 on the implementation of minimum safety and health requirements at temporary or mobile construction sites (eighth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16 (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC)




COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/57/EEC of 24 June 1992 on the implementation of minimum safety and health requirements at temporary or mobile constructions sites (eighth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16 (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC)


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 118a thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1), submitted after consulting the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work,


In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas Article 118a of the Treaty provides that the Council shall adopt, by means of directives, minimum requirements for encouraging improvements, especially in the working environment, to ensure a better level of protection of the safety and health of workers;


Whereas, under the terms of that Article, those directives are to avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings;


Whereas the communication from the Commission on its programme concerning safety, hygiene and health at work (4) provides for the adoption of a Directive designed to guarantee the safety and health of workers at temporary or mobile construction sites;


Whereas, in its resolution of 21 December 1987 on safety, hygiene and health at work (5), the Council took note of the Commission's intention of submitting to the Council in the near future minimum requirements concerning temporary or mobile construction sites;


Whereas temporary or mobile construction sites constitute an area of activity that exposes workers to particularly high levels of risk;


Whereas unsatisfactory architectural and/or organizational options or poor planning of the works at the project preparation stage have played a role in more than half of the occupational accidents occurring on construction sites in the Community;


Whereas in each Member State the authorities responsible for safety and health at work must be informed, before the beginning of the works, of the execution of works the scale of which exceeds a certain threshold;


Whereas, when a project is being carried out, a large number of occupational accidents may be caused by inadequate coordination, particularly where various undertakings work simultaneously or in succession at the same temporary or mobile construction site;


Whereas it is therefore necessary to improve coordination between the various parties concerned at the project preparation stage and also when the work is being carried out;


Whereas compliance with the minimum requirements designed to guarantee a better standard of safety and health at temporary or mobile construction sites is essential to ensure the safety and health of workers;


Whereas, moreover, self-employed persons and employers, where they are personally engaged in work activity, may, through their activities on a temporary or mobile construction site, jeopardize the safety and health of workers;


Whereas it is therefore necessary to extend to self-employed persons and to employers where they are personally engaged in work activity on the site certain relevant provisions of Council Directive 89/655/EEC of 30 November 1989 concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the use of work equipment by workers at work (second individual Directive) (6), and of Council Directive 89/656/EEC of 30 November 1989 on the minimum health and safety requirements for the use by workers of personal protective equipment at the workplace (third individual Directive) (7);


Whereas this Directive is an individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16 (1) of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (8); whereas, therefore, the provisions of the said Directive are fully applicable to temporary or mobile construction sites, without prejudice to more stringent and/or specific provisions contained in this Directive;


Whereas this Directive constitutes a practical step towards the achievement of the social dimension of the internal market with special reference to the subject matter of Council Directive 89/106/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to construction products (9) and the subject matter covered by Council Directive 89/440/EEC of 18 July 1989 amending Directive 71/305/EEC concerning coordination of procedures for the award of public work contracts (10);


Whereas, pursuant to Council Decision 74/325/EEC (11), the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work is consulted by the Commission with a view to drawing up proposals in this field,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


Article 1


Subject


1. This Directive, which is the eighth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16 (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC, lays down minimum safety and health requirements for temporary or mobile construction sites, as defined in Article 2 (a).

This Directive shall not apply to drilling and extraction in the extractive industries within the meaning of Article 1 (2) of Council Decision 74/326/EEC of 27 June 1974 on the extension of the responsibilities of the Mines Safety and Health Commission to all mineral-extracting industries (12).

Council Directive 92/102/EEC of 27 November 1992 on the identification and registration of animals




COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/102/EEC of 27 November 1992 on the identification and registration of animals


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Whereas Article 3 (1) (c) of Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnicial checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (3), states that animals for intra-Community trade must be identified in accordance with the requirements of Community rules and be registered in such a way that the original or transit holding, centre or organization can be traced, and that before 1 January 1993 these identification and registration systems are to be extended to the movements of animals with the territory of each Member State;


Whereas Article 14 of Council Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries and amending Directives 89/662/EEC, 90/425/EEC and 90/675/EEC (4), states that the identification and registration as provided for in Article 3 (1) (c) of Directive 90/425/EEC of such animals must, except in the case of animals for slaughter and registered equidae, be carried out after the said checks have been made;


Whereas the management of certain Community aid schemes in the field of agriculture requires the individual identification of certain types of livestock; whereas the identification and registration system must, therefore, be suitable for the application and control of such measures;


Whereas it is necessary to ensure the rapid and efficient exchange of information between Member States for the correct application of this Directive; whereas Community provisions have been established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1468/81 of 19 May 1981 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs or agricultural matters (5) and by Council Directive 89/608/EEC of 21 November 1989 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of legislation on veterinary and zootechnical matters (6);


Whereas keepers of animals must maintain up-to-date records of the animals on their holdings; whereas persons involved in the commerce of animals must keep records of their dealings; whereas the competent authority must have access to these records on request;


Whereas in order to permit movements of animals to be traced rapidly and accurately, animals must be able to be identified; whereas the form and content of the mark, with respect to bovine animals, must be determined on a Community basis; whereas, with regard to pigs, sheep and goats, a decision should be taken at a later date to determine the nature of the mark and, pending such decision, the national systems of identification should be maintained for movements restricted to the national market;


Whereas provision should be made for the possibility of waiving the requirements for marks in the case of animals moving directly from a farm to a slaughterhouse; whereas, however, these animals must in any case be identified so that their farm of origin can be traced;


Whereas provision should be made for the possibility of waiving the obligation to register the keepers of animals kept for personal purposes and, in order to take into account certain particular cases, the procedures for keeping registers;


Whereas in the case of animals in which the mark has become illegible or been lost, a new mark enabling a link with the previous mark to be established must be applied;


Whereas this Directive must not affect specific requirements contained in Commission Decision 89/153/EEC of 13 February 1989 concerning the correlation of samples taken for residue examination with animals and their farms of origin (7) or any relevant applicatory rules established in accordance with Directive 91/496/EEC;


Whereas provision must be made for a management committee procedure for the adoption of any necessary implementing rules for this Directive,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


Article 1


This Directive sets out the minimum requirements for the identification and registration of animals, without prejudice to more detailed Community rules which may be established for disease eradication or control purposes.


It shall apply without prejudice to Decision 89/153/EEC and to implementing rules laid down in accordance with Directive 91/496/EEC, and taking account of Article 5 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 of 27 November 1992 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes (8).


Article 2


For the purposes of this Directive:


(a) animal shall mean any animal of the species referred to in Directives 64/432/EEC (9) and 91/68/EEC (10);


(b) holding shall mean any establishment, construction or, in the case of an open-air farm, any place in which animals are held, kept or handled;


(c) keeper shall mean any natural or legal person responsible, even on a temporary basis, for animals;


(d) competent authority shall mean the central authority of a Member State competent to carry out veterinary checks or any authority to which it has delegated that competence for the purposes of implementing this Directive;


(e) trade shall mean trade as defined in Article 2 of Directive 90/425/EEC.


Article 3


1. Member States shall ensure that:


(a) the competent authority has an up-to-date list of all the holdings which keep animals covered by this Directive and are situated on its territory, specifying the species of animals kept and their keepers, such holdings to remain on the said list until three consecutive years have elapsed with no animals on the holding. This list shall also include the mark or marks which permit the identification of the holding in accordance with Article 5 (2) (a) and (c), second subparagraph, and paragraph (3), first subparagraph, and also Article 8;


(b) the Commission, the competent authority and any authority responsible for supervising application of Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 can have access to all information obtained under this Directive.


2. Member States may be authorized under the procedure laid down in Article 18 of Directive 90/425/EEC to exclude from the list in paragraph 1 (a) natural persons who keep no more than three animals of the ovine or caprine species for which they do not seek premiums or, to take account of particular circumstances, one pig and which are intended for their own use or consumption, provided that any such animals are the subject of the controls laid down in this Directive before any movement.


Article 4


1. Member States shall ensure that:


(a) any keeper of bovine or porcine animals listed in Directive 64/432/EEC and contained in the list provided for in Article 3 (1) (a) keeps a register stating the number of animals present on the holding.


This register shall include an up-to-date record of all births, deaths and movements (numbers of animals concerned by each entering and leaving operation) at least on the basis of aggregate movements, stating as appropriate their origin or destination, and the date of such movements.


The identification mark applied in conformity with Articles 5 and 8 shall be stated in all cases.


However, for animals of the porcine species, it shall not be obligatory to include births and deaths.


In the case of pure-bred and hybrid pigs, which are entered in a herd book in accordance with Directive 88/661/EEC (11), an alternative registration system based on individual identification allowing the animals to be identified may be recognized by the procedure laid down in Article 18 of Directive 90/425/EEC if it offers guarantees equivalent to a register;


(b) any keeper of sheep or goats whose holding is listed in accordance with Article 3 (1) (a) shall keep a register including at least the total number of sheep and goats present on the holding each year on a date to be determined by the competent authority.


The register shall also include:


- an up-to-date statement of the number of live female sheep and goats which are over 12 months of age or which have given birth present on the holding;


- the movements (numbers of animals concerned by each entering or leaving operation) of sheep and goats on at least the basis of aggregate movements stating as appropriate their origin or destination, their mark and the date of such movements.


2. However, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18 of Directive 90/425/EEC, a simplified registration procedure shall be established before 1 January 1993 for buffalo and before 1 October 1994 for sheep and goats in transhumance and for all the abovementioned animals kept on common pasture or raised in regions which are isolated geographically.


3. Member States shall also ensure that:


(a) any keeper supplies the competent authority, upon request, with all information concerning the origin, identification and, where appropriate, the destination of animals which he has owned, kept, transported, marketed or slaughtered;


(b) any keeper of animals to be moved to or from a market or collection centre provides a document, setting out details of the animals including the identification numbers or marks of any bovine animals, to the operator, on the market or in the collection centre, who is a keeper of the animals, on a temporary basis.


That operator may use the documents obtained in accordance with the first subparagraph to carry out the obligations laid down in paragraph 1 (a), third subparagraph.


(c) the registers and information are available on the holding and to the competent authority, upon request, for a minimum period to be determined by the competent authority but which may not be less than three years.


Article 5


1. Member States shall ensure that the following general principles are respected:


(a) identification marks must be applied before animals leave the holding of birth;


(b) no mark may be removed or replaced without the permission of the competent authority.


Where a mark has become illegible or has been lost, a new mark shall be applied in accordance with this Article;


(c) the keeper shall record any new mark in the register referred to in Article 4 in order to establish a link with the previous mark applied to the animal;


(d) the eartag provided for in paragraph 2 (a) shall be approved by the competent authority and shall be tamper-proof and easy to read for the animal's lifetime. It shall be incapable of re-use. It shall be such as to remain on the animal without interfering with its well-being.


2. For bovine animals, Member States shall ensure that:


(a) all animals listed in Article 2 of Directive 64/432/EEC present on the holding are identified with an eartag bearing on alphanumeric code, which shall not exceed 14 characters, which make it possible to identify each animal individually along with the holding on which it was born or, in the case of bulls intended for cultural and sporting events with the exception of fairs and exhibitions, by an identification system offering equivalent guarantees recognized by the Commission.


The eartags referred to in the first subparagraph must be applied no later than nine months after the date of adoption, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18 of Directive 90/425/EEC of measures providing for the identification of the Member State and the holding of origin. Animals identified before the end of this nine-month period must be marked either in accordance with the national systems provided for in the third subparagraph or with the eartag provided for in the first subparagraph.


Under the procedure laid down in Article 18 of Directive 90/425/EEC such period shall be at the request of a Member State, be extended until 1 July 1994.


However, animals which have been identified before the expiry of the nine-month period in accordance with the national systems in force and notified to the Commission shall continue to be subject to control on that basis;


(b) the identification marks are allocated to the holding, distributed and applied to the animals in a manner determined by the competent authority;


(c) the identification marks are applied, at the latest, within thirty days of the birth of the animal.


However, the competent authority may defer the application of this mark until the animal has attained a maximum age of six months, if the animal is, before the age of 30 days, provided by the keeper with a provisional mark recognized by the competent authority which makes it possible to identify each animal to the holding of birth, and provided that these animals may not leave the holding except for slaughter in a slaughterhouse situated in the territory of the competent authority which has recognized the provisional mark, without passing through any other holding.


However, the competent authority may permit vealcalves intended for slaughter before the age of six months and which are moved before the age of 30 days in accordance with a national system of movement, recognized in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18 of Directive 90/425/EEC, which provides at least for tracing back to the holding of origin, to be marked at the fattening holding, provided that the calves were transferred there directly from the holding of birth and that the calves moved under such systems will not be eligible for premiums.


3. Animals other than bovine animals must be marked as soon as possible, and in any case before they leave the holding, with an eartag or tattoo making it possible to determine the holding from which they came and enabling reference to be made to any accompanying document which must mention such eartag or tattoo and to the list referred to in Article 3 (1) (a).


Member States may, pending the decision provided for in Article 10 of this Decision and by derogation from the second paragraph of Article 3 (1) (c) of Directive 90/425/EEC, apply their national systems for the movement of animals other than bovine animals for all movements of such animals in their territories. Such systems must enable the holding from which they came and the holding on which they were born to be identified. Member States shall notify the Commission of the systems which they intend to introduce for this purpose, on 1 July 1993 for pigs and on 1 July 1994 for sheep and goats. In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 18 of Directive 90/425/EEC, a Member State may be asked to make amendments to its system where it does not fulfil the requirement referred to in the second sentence.


Animals bearing a temporary mark identifying a consignment must be accompanied throughout their movement by a document which enables the origin, ownership, place of departure and destination to be determined.


However, the competent authority may authorize the movement of sheep and goats without marks between holdings with the same health status in the same ownership and situated in that authority's territory, provided that each such movement occurs under a national system which enables the animal to be traced back to the holding on which it was born. Member States must notify by 1 July 1994 the Commission of the systems which they intend introducing to this end. Pursuant to the procedure laid down in


Article 18


of Directive 90/425/EEC, a Member State may be requested to amend this system where it fails to meet the aforementioned requirement.


4. Point (e) of Article 3 (2) of Directive 64/432/EEC shall read:


'(e) be identified in accordance with Article 5 of 32.' Council Directive 92/102/EEC on the identification and registration of animals (*).


(*) OJ No L 355, 5. 12. 1992, p. 32.'


Article 6


1. Where the competent authority of the Member State of destination decides not to keep the identification mark allocated to the animal in the holding of origin all charges incurred as a result of replacing the mark shall be borne by that authority. Where the mark has been so replaced, a link shall be established between the identification allocated by the competent authority of the Member State of dispatch and the new identification allocated by the competent authority of the Member State of destination; that link shall be recorded in the register provided for in Article 4.


The option in the first subparagraph may not be invoked in the case of animals intended for slaughter which are imported under Article 8 without bearing a new mark in accordance with Article 5.


2. Where the animals have been traded, the competent authority of the Member State of destination may, for the purposes of Article 5 of Directive 90/425/EEC, have recourse to Article 4 of Directive 89/608/EEC in order to obtain the information relating to the animals, their herd of origin and any movement to which they have been subject.


Article 7


Member States shall ensure that any information relating to movements of animals not accompanied by a certificate or a document required by veterinary or zootechnical legislation remains available to the competent authority, upon request, for a minimum period to be set by the latter.


Article 8


Any animal imported from a third country which has passed the checks laid down by Directive 91/496/EEC and which remains within Community territory shall, within thirty days of undergoing the aforesaid checks, and, in any event, before their movement, be identified by a mark complying with Article 5 unless the holding of destination is a slaughterhouse situated on the territory of the competent authority responsible for veterinary checks and the animal is actually slaughtered within that 30-day period.


A link shall be established between the identification established by the third country and the identification allocated to it by the Member State of destination. That link shall be recorded in the register provided for in Article 4.


Article 9


Member States shall adopt necessary administrative and/or penal measures to punish any infringement of Community veterinary legislation, where it is established that the marking or identification or the keeping of registers provided for in


Article 4


has not been carried out in conformity with the requirements of this Directive.


Article 10


Not later than 31 December 1996, acting on the basis of a report from the Commission, accompanied by any proposals, on which it will decide by a qualified majority the Council shall, in the light of experience gained, review the provisions of this Directive with a view to defining a harmonized Community identification and registration system and shall decide on the possibility of introducing electronic identification arrangements in the light of progress achieved in this field by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).


Article 11


1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply wiht this Directive:


- for the requirements regarding bovine animals, so that:


(i) the bovine animals, as from 1 February 1993, are registered in accordance with existing national procedures complying with the requirements laid down in Article 4 and are identified in accordance with the existing rules referred to in Article 5 (2) (a), second and third subparagraph;


(ii) the Community registration and identification systems laid down by this Directive are set up as from 1 October 1993,


- before 1 January 1994 for the requirements regarding porcine animals,


- before 1 January 1995 for the requirements regarding ovine and caprine animals.


They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.


When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such a reference shall be laid down by the Member States.


2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.


3. The setting of the deadline for transposition into national law at 1 January 1994 and 1 January 1995 shall be without prejudice to the abolition of veterinary checks at frontiers provided for in Directive 90/425/EEC.

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2252/92 of 30 July 1992 laying down detailed rules for applying the special scheme for raspberries intended for processing




COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2252/92 of 30 July 1992 laying down detailed rules for applying the special scheme for raspberries intended for processing


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1991/92 of 13 July 1992 establishing a special scheme for raspberries intended for processing (1), and in particular Article 8 thereof,


Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the united of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposs of the common agricultural policy (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2205/90 (3), and in particular Article 5 (3) thereof,


Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1991/92 inlcudes specific provisions to remedy the deficiencies in the production and marketing of raspberries intended for processing; whereas the aid provided for is paid to specifically recognized producers' organizations which have submitted a programme to improve the competitiveness of the sector approved by the competent national authority;


Whereas it should be recalled that this specific recognition is not conditional on previous recognition pursuant to Article 13 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1992 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1754/92 (5); whereas recognition is granted independently of the latter provided that the particular conditions laid down for granting it are observed;


Whereas the conditions for recognition must include reasonable assurances that the producers' organizations in receipt of Community aid will, through the extent and duration of their activities and through their modus operandi, contribute to the desired improvement in the conditions under which the products in question are produced and marketed; whereas, to ensure minimum stability in the producers' organizations, they must of necessity include in their statutes specific clauses guaranteeing producers control over the decisions and functioning of the organization and clauses laying down penalties for infringing the rules agreed;


Whereas the marketed quantities should be determined for the payment of the flat-rate aid to recognized producers' organizations which have presented a programme to improve the competitiveness of the sector, approved by the competent national authority; whereas unfavourable weather conditions in the production region during the relevant marketing year for calculating the aid may introduce very noticeable distortions in the application of the aid scheme; whereas provision should be made to calculate the aid in such cases on the basis of the quantities marketed in the marketing year following the year noticeably affected by the aforementioned wheather conditions;


Whereas the various measures, which may inlcude individual or joint measures provided for under the programme to improve the comeptitiveness of the sector producing raspberries for processing, should be determined; whereas, although if falls to the national authorities to approve the programmes, collaboration and administrative cooperation with the Commission for the purpose of guaranteeing the aims of the regulations should allow the Commission to request, where necessary, amendments to the draft programme or even reject the granting of both national and Community financial assistance;


Whereas specific rules should be drawn up for the approval of joint measures in the programmes of producers' organizations located in the same production zone and, even more importantly, for the approval of transnational measures;


Whereas certain general and financial provisions should be laid down for aid financed by the European Agricultrual Guidance and Guarantee Fund, Guarantee Section, subject to the conditions laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1991/92; whereas it should be recalled that Community aid may only be paid in any event to the Member State after or at the vbery most at the same time that the national contribution is paid out, subsequent to appropriate checks;


Whereas the maximum amount of aid per hectare, fixed for measures relating to cultural and/or varietyl improvement of production, should be converted into the national currency concerned at the agricultural conversion rate applicable on the first day of each marketing year, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85;


Whereas implementation of the various specific measures in question involves a compelling obligation on the beneficiary producers' organization to submit full and detailed information, at determined intervals, to the authority appointed by Member State so as to allow the said authority to monitor the fulfilment of the committments entered into by the producers' organization;


Whereas the obligation on the aid beneficiary to provide information cannot in itself guarantee that the measures are well administered; whereas it is therefore necessary to specify the documentary checks and-on-the spot inspections which the national authority must carry out, depending on the type of financial assistance provided for in the said Regulation;


Whereas the most serious failures to comply with the obligations laid down in Regulation (EEC) No 1991/92 or in this Regulation must be appropriately penalized;


Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3769/92 of 21 December 1992 implementing and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90 laying down measures to be taken to discourage the diversion of certain substances to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances




COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 3769/92 of 21 December 1992 implementing and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90 laying down measures to be taken to discourage the diversion of certain substances to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90 of 13 December 1990 laying down measures to be taken to discourage the diversion of certain substances to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances (1), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 900/92 (2), and in particular Article 10 (3) thereof,


Whereas it is necessary to lay down implementing rules for Regulation (EEC) No 3677/90, hereinafter referred to as 'the basic Regulation`;


Whereas the threshold quantities of the scheduled substances listed in Category 3 of the Annex to the basic Regulation and the identification of mixtures containing such substances should be defined for the purpose of Article 2a (2) of the basic Regulation;


Whereas it is necessary to identify the countries and substances pursuant to Article 5 (2) of the basic Regulation, in particular, on the basis of a concerted approach with the country concerned;


Whereas, in certain cases, when there is no formal agreement with the destination country within the meaning of Article 5a (2) of the basic Regulation, the export requirements for scheduled substances in Category 3 must be identified, in particular, on the basis of a concerted approach with the country concerned;


Whereas the identification of sensitive destinations has to take place on the basis that a country is concerned, either by the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances or by other relevant factors such as geographical proximity to a country in which such drugs or substances are produced;


Whereas the Commission undertakes to establish such contacts with a number of countries; the lists in Annexes 2 and 3 to this Regulation should therefore be gradually supplemented to the extent that such contacts lead to concrete results;


Whereas it is necessary to design a model of the individual export authorization as well as detailed rules concerning its use and furthermore to establish such rules for implementing the open individual authorization scheme provided for in relation to certain exports of Category 2 and 3 substances;


Whereas the Community should implement the decision taken by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) of the United Nations in April 1992 to include the substances safrole, piperonal and isosafrole in Table I of the Annex to the 1988 UN Convention against illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, by transferring the said substances from Category 2 to Category 1 in the Annex to the basic Regulation and for reasons of clarity the Annex to the basic Regulation should therefore be replaced; the decision was based on the grounds that the characteristics of the said substances are very similar to those already contained in Table I as well as those in Category 1 of the Final Report of the Chemical Action Task Force (CATF), and the CATF members represented in the CND have fully shared the decision as an exceptional measure relating to international trade which would provide no precedent as to other possible divergences with regard to the classification under the CATF report;


Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Drugs Precursors Committee,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


Exemptions from the registration requirement for scheduled substances listed in Category 3 1. Operators engaged in the export of scheduled substances listed in Category 3 of the Annex to the basic Regulation shall be exempt from the registration requirement laid down in Article 2a (2) of the basic Regulation if the sum of quantities concerned by their exports during the course of the preceding calendar year (1 January - 31 December) does not exceed the amounts specified in Annex 1 to this Regulation. However, as soon as such amounts are exceeded within the current calendar year, the registration requirement must be complied with immediately.


2. In the case of mixtures within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 1 (2) (a) of the basic Regulation, containing substances listed in Category 3, operators shall be exempt from the registration requirement referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article if the amount of the scheduled substance contained therein does not exceed, during the course of the preceding calendar year, the amounts referred to in the said paragraph 1. However, as soon as such amounts are exceeded within the current calendar year, the registration requirement must be complied with immediately.


3. For the purpose of creating the register, those operators whose exports of Category 3 substances during 1992 have exceeded the amounts specified in Annex 1, and who intend to continue to export those substances, are required to register with the competent authorities and notify the information referred to in Article 2a (2) of the basic Regulation by 31 January 1993.


Article 2


Specific export requirements for substances in Category 2


Pursuant to Article 5 (2) of the basic Regulation, exports of scheduled substances in Category 2 and listed in Annex 2 to this Regulation are subject mutatis mutandis to the provisions of Article 4 of the basic Regulation whenever they are destined to an operator established in a country which is listed in that Annex.


Article 3


Specific export requirements for substances in Category 3


Without prejudice to more specific requirements to be determined on the basis of agreements with countries concerned, exports of scheduled substances in Category 3 are subject to the provisions of Article 4 of the basic Regulation whenever they are destined to an operator established in a country which is listed in Annex 3 to this Regulation for the substance concerned pursuant to Article 5a (2) of the basic Regulation and an open individual authorization cannot be granted pursuant to paragraph 3 of that Article.


Article 4


Model export authorization


1. The export authorization referred to in Article 4 of the basic Regulation shall be made out on the form, a specimen of which is given in Annex 4 to this Regulation.

COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3578/92 of 7 December 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70 on the granting of aids for transport by rail, road and inland waterway


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 75 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70 (4) provides that Member States may promote the development of combined transport by granting aid relating to investment in infrastructure and in the fixed and moveable facilities necessary for transhipment or to the running costs of an intra-Community combined transport service in transit across the territory of non-member countries;


Whereas the evolution of combined transport shows that for the Community as a whole the starting-up phase of this technology has not been completed yet, and whereas the aid arrangements should therefore be maintained for a further period;


Whereas the possibility of granting such aid for the running costs of combined transport services crossing the territory of a non-member country is warranted only in the specific cases of Austria, Switzerland and the States of the former Yugoslavia;


Whereas the need to achieve economic and social cohesion rapidly in the Community entails putting the emphasis on investment in rail and road facilities specific to combined transport, in particular where they present an aternative to infrastructure work that cannot be completed in the short term;


Whereas, in addition, providing aid for road facilities specific to combined transport would be an effective way of encouraging small and medium-sized undertakings to avail themselves of combined transport services;


Whereas aid for equipment specific to combined transport would foster the development of new bimodal and transhipment technology;


Whereas during a limited start-up phase the possibility of granting aid should therefore be extended to investment in transport facilities specifically designed for combined transport, provided that they are used exclusively for that purpose;


Whereas the present aid arrangements should be maintained in force until 31 December 1995 and the Council should decide, under the conditions laid down in the Treaty, on the arrangements to be applied subsequently or, if necessary, on the conditions for terminating such aid;


Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70 should therefore be amended,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


Item 1 (e) of Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 1107/70 is hereby replaced by the following:


'(e) until 31 December 1995, where the aids are granted as a temporary measure and are designed to facilitate the development of combined transport, such aids must relate to:


- investment in infrastructure,


or


- investment in fixed and moveable facilities necessary for transhipment,


or


- investment in transport equipment specifically designed for combined transport and used exclusively in combined transport,


or


- costs of running combined transport services in transit across Austria, Switzerland or the States of the former Yugoslavia.


The Commission shall submit a progress report on the above measures to the Council every two years giving details, inter alia, of the destination of the aids, their amount and their impact on combined transport. Member States shall supply the Commission with the information needed to compile the report.


By 31 December 1995 the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, shall decide under the conditions laid down in the Treaty, on the arrangements to be applied subsequently or, if necessary, on the conditions for terminating them.'


Article 2


This Regulation shall enter into force on the third day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.

Council Regulation (EEC) No 3125/92 of 26 October 1992 on the arrangements applicable to the importation into the Community of sheepmeat and goatmeat products originating in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia




COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3125/92 of 26 October 1992 on the arrangements applicable to the importation into the Community of sheepmeat and goatmeat products originating in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,


Whereas the normal and balanced administration of the Agreement in the form of an exchange of letters between the European Economic Community and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on trade in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector (1), which entered into force on 1 January 1981 hereafter referred to as the '1981 Agreement', as adjusted by the 1990 Agreement (2) which entered into force on 1 January 1989, has proved to be impossible on account of the changes which have taken place since 1991 in that Republic; whereas the creation of new Republics, some of which are recognized by the Community, has given rise to exceptional circumstances justifying a change in the conditions under which the 1981 Agreement is administered;


Whereas, in order to avoid, in the case of certain new Republics, a disruption of the pattern of trade which has traditionally existed under the 1981 Agreement, it would be appropriate, while maintaining the substance of the Agreement, to suspend its system of administration and provide, on a temporary basis, for the exclusive administration of the agreed arrangements by the Community; whereas in this respect the issue of an import licence should no longer be conditional on the submission of a Yugoslav export licence and steps should be taken to ensure the fair distribution of the quantities agreed among the various Republics;


Whereas, in order to ensure this fair distribution of imports among the Republics in question, rules should be laid down for checking the origin of the products imported;


Whereas this Regulation is without prejudice to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1432/92 of 1 June 1992 prohibiting trade between the European Economic Community and the Republics of Serbia and Montenegro (3);


Whereas this Regulation is without prejudice to Council Directive 72/462/EEC of 12 December 1972 on health and veterinary inspection problems upon importation of bovine, ovine and caprine animals and swine, fresh meat or meat products from third countries (4),


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


The administration of the import arrangements laid down in points 9 and 10 of the 1981 Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia on trade in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector and in points 2 and 3 of the 1990 Adjustment Agreement is hereby suspended and replaced by the arrangements laid down in this Regulation.


Article 2


1. In order to comply with the 1981 Agreement and in particular the quantities specified therein, the importation of any of the products specified in the said Agreement shall be conditional on the submission of an import licence as provided for in Article 15 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 of 25 September 1989 on the common organization of the market in sheepmeat and goatmeat (5). The issue of such licence shall be conditional on the provision of a security as a guarantee that importation will be effected during the period of validity of the licence. The security shall be wholly or partially forfeit if the operation is not carried out, or is only partially carried out, within that time limit.


2. Applications for an import licence shall be accompanied by a document setting out the name of the Republic in which the products concerned originate.


3. Upon issue of import licences for the products referred to in the 1981 Agreement, care must be taken to ensure a fair distribution of the licences among the various Republics, paying particular attention to the distribution of production among those Republics.


4. For as long as the ban introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 1432/92 remains in place, applications for import licences for products originating in Serbia or Montenegro shall be refused.


Article 3


1. Detailed rules for the application of this Regulation shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89.


2. The detailed rules shall concern in particular:


(a) the issue of import licences on the basis of the criterion referred to in Article 2 (3) and, where necessary, the adoption or rules on the origin of the products concerned;


(b) the suspension for the remainder of the year of imports originating in the various Republics if during that period:


- the imports originating in the various Republics exceed the quantities referred to in the 1981 Agreement, or


- the monitoring imports from one of those Republics exceed the quantities arising from the fair distribution referred to in Article 2 (3);


(c) the monitoring, on the basis of the monthly price average, of the prices at which lamb carcases and live animals originating in the Republics referred to in this Regulation are imported into each Member State;


(d) the guarantees of origin to be given by the various Republics before application for import licences, referred to in Article 2 (2), can be made;


(e) the determination of the measures to be taken, if necessary, in cases where a drop in the prices for lamb carcases and/or live animals imported from the Republics is observed in a Member State and is indicative of a problem;


(f) the temporary measures necessary to facilitate the introduction of the import arrangements provided for in this Regulation.


Article 4


This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

Council Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in raw tobacco




COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2075/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in raw tobacco


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 42 and 43 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas the operation and development of the common market for agricultural products must be accompanied by the establishment of a common agricultural policy to include in particular a common organization of markets which may take various forms depending on the product;


Whereas it is the purpose of the common agricultural policy to achieve the objectives of Article 39 of the Treaty, and, in particular in the raw tobacco sector, the stabilization of markets and a fair standard of living for the agricultural population concerned; whereas these objectives may be achieved by adapting resources to requirements, in particular by means of a quality policy;


Whereas the present situation on the tobacco market, on which supply does not correspond to demand, calls for a substantial overhaul of the Community arrangements which have governed the market hitherto, while ensuring the continuation of tobacco growing by the traditional producers; whereas such an overhaul requires simplification of the market management mechanisms, limitation of production in line with the requirements of the market and the demands of the budget, and stronger means of control to ensure that the management mechanisms fully achieve the objectives of the common market organization;


Whereas tobacco varieties can be classified in groups according to cultivation technique and production costs, taking account of the descriptions used in international trade;


Whereas competition on the tobacco market calls for some support of traditional tobacco producers; whereas such support should be based on a premium system allowing the disposal of tobacco in the Community;


Whereas the premium system can be managed efficiently by means of cultivation contracts between growers and first processors which guarantee stable outlets to the growers and regular supplies to the processor; whereas payment of a sum equivalent to the premium by the processor to the producer at the time of delivery of the tobacco covered by the contract, subject to compliance with the quality requirements, provides support for the growers while facilitating management of the premium system;


Whereas, in order to limit Community tobacco production and to discourage the production of varieties which are not readily disposed of, a maximum global guarantee threshold should be laid down for the Community and divided annually into specific guarantee thresholds for the respective groups of varieties;


Whereas, to ensure that the guarantee thresholds are observed, a processing quota system must be instituted for a limited period; whereas for a transitional period the Member States must allocate, within the guarantee thresholds, processing quotas to the firms concerned, the Community rules laid down for the purpose being applied to ensure fair allocation on the basis of quantities processed in the past, but disregarding any abnormal production levels; whereas the necessary measures will be taken to permit the quotas to be allocated to the producers subsequently, under satisfactory conditions; whereas Member States possessing the necessary data to allocate quotas to producers on the basis of past performance, should be authorized to do so;


Whereas first processors must not conclude cultivation contracts for quantities exceeding the quotas allocated; whereas reimbursement of the premium must be limited to an amount corresponding to the quota;


Whereas provision should be made initially for the premium and production limitation systems to run until 1997 so that they can be reviewed in the light of experience and possibly adapted for the subsequent period;


Whereas measures to orientate production can help to stabilize the tobacco market and improve the quality of production; whereas specific aid will enable producer groups to contribute towards the improvement of the organization and orientation of production; whereas a research programe financed with the proceeds of a deduction from the premium will enable tobacco growing to be brought more closely into line with Community requirements as regards public health; whereas, lastly, a conversion programme for growers of Mavra, Tsebelia, Forchheimer Havanna IIc and hybrids of Geudertheimer tobacco is necessary because of the importance of these varieties for the economy of certain Community regions;


Whereas the establishment of a single market requires a single system of trade at the external frontiers;


Whereas quantitative restrictions at the Community's external frontiers can be dispensed with; whereas, however, should exceptional circumstances arise, in order not to leave the Community market without protection against any disturbance, the Community should be able to take all the necessary measures without delay;


Whereas unforeseen market circumstances may necessitate the adoption by the Commission of exceptional market support measures;


Whereas the achievement of a single market would be jeopardized by the grant of certain aids; whereas the Treaty provisions governing the appraisal of aids granted by Member States and the prohibition of aids incompatible with the common market should be applied to the tobacco sector;


Whereas, in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (4), the Community should bear financial responsibility for expenditure incurred by Member States pursuant to this Regulation;


Whereas experience shows that more stringent controls in the tobacco sector are essential, whereas in appropriate cases certain powers of control could be assigned to an independent supervisory agency to deal with the specific requirements of the tobacco market;


Whereas the common organization of the tobacco market must take account, simultaneously and appropriately, of the objectives laid down in Article 39 and 110 of the Treaty;


Whereas the transition from the arrangements instituted by Council Regulation (EEC) No 727/70 of 21 April 1970 on the common organization of the market in raw tobacco (5), to the arrangements provided for herein must take place in the best possible conditions; whereas transitional measures may prove necessary to ensure this; whereas the new arrangements should not become fully applicable until the 1993 harvest,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


The common organization of the market in raw tobacco shall comprise rules on:


- a premium system,


- measures to orientate and limit production,


- arrangements for trade with third countries.


The common organization shall cover raw or unmanufactured tobacco and tobacco refuse falling within CN heading 2401.


Article 2


Raw tobacco varieties shall be classified in the following groups:


(a) flue-cured:


tobacco dried in ovens with controlled air circulation, temperature and humidity;


(b) light air-cured:


tobacco dried in the air under cover, not left to ferment;


(c) dark air-cured:


tobacco dried in the air under cover, left to ferment naturally before being marketed;


(d) sun-cured:


tobacco dried in the sun;


(e) fire-cured:


tobacco dried by fire;


(f) Basma (sun-cured);

(h) Kaba-Koulak (classic) and similar (sun-cured).


The varieties in each group are listed in the Annex.


TITLE I Premium system


Article 3


1. From the 1993 harvest until the 1997 harvest a premium system shall be applied. The amount of the premium shall be the same for the tobacco varieties in each of the various groups.


2. However, for flue-cured, light air-cured and dark air-cured tobaccos grown in Belgium, Germany and France, a supplementary amount shall be granted. This amount shall be equal to 50 % of the difference between the premium granted for these tobaccos in accordance with paragraph 1 and the premium applicable for the 1992 harvest.


3. The purpose of the premium shall be to supplement the incomes of producers whose products correspond to market requirements and to facilitate the disposal of tobacco produced in the Community.


Article 4


1. In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty, the Council shall fix the amount of the premium and the supplementary amounts for each tobacco harvest, taking particular account of past and foreseeable possibilities for the disposal of the various types of tobacco, under normal conditions of competition, on the Community and world markets.


2. The amount of the premium shall be fixed:


(a) per kilogram of leaf tobacco not having undergone first processing and market preparation;


(b) for each group of raw tobacco.


Article 5


Granting of the premium shall be subject in particular to the following conditions:


(a) the tobacco must come from a production area specified for the variety concerned;


(b) quality requirements must be fulfilled;


(c) the leaf tobacco must be delivered by the producer to the premises of the first processor under a cultivation contract.


Article 6


1. Cultivation contracts shall comprise:


- an undertaking by the first processor to pay to the grower, in addition to the purchase price, a sum equal to the premium at the time of delivery for the quantity under contract and effectively delivered;


- an undertaking by the grower to deliver to the premises of the first processor raw tobacco corresponding to the quality requirements.


2. The competent body shall reimburse the amount of the premium to the first processor against presentation of proof that the grower has delivered the tobacco and that the amount referred to in paragraph 1 has been paid.


Article 7


Detailed rules for the application of this Title shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23.


They shall comprise:


- delimitation of the production areas for each variety,


- quality requirements for delivered tobacco,


- additional points to be included in the cultivation contract and the final date for its conclusion,


- the possible obligation for the first processor to provide a security if he requests an advance, and the conditions governing the provision and release of the said security,


- specific conditions for the grant of the premium in cases where the cultivation contract is concluded with a group of producers,


- measures to be taken in the event of failure of the grower or first processor to fulfil his statutory obligations.


TITLE II System of production limitation


Article 8


A maximum global guarantee threshold for the Community is hereby fixed at 350 000 tonnes of raw leaf tobacco per harvest. However, for 1993, this threshold is fixed at 370 000 tonnes.


Every year, within this limit the Council shall fix, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty, a specific guarantee threshold for each group of varieties, taking particular account of market conditions and socio-economic and agronomic conditions in the production areas concerned.


Article 9


1. To ensure observance of the guarantee thresholds a system of processing quotas is hereby instituted for the harvests of 1993 to 1997.


2. For each harvest, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty, the Council shall allocate among the producer Member States the quantities available for each group of varieties.


3. On the basis of the quantities allocated pursuant to paragraph 2 and without prejudice to the application of paragraph 5, Member States shall distribute processing quotas on a transnational basis for the 1993 and 1994 harvests among the first processors in proportion to the average quantities delivered for processing during the three years preceding the year of the last harvest, broken down by group of varieties. However, production in 1992 and deliveries from this harvest shall not be taken into account. The procedure for allocating processing quotas for the following harvests shall not be affected by this allocation.


First processors who start business after the beginning of the reference period shall obtain a quantity proportional to the average quantity delivered for processing during their period of business.


For first processors which begin business in the year of harvest or during the preceding year, Member States shall reserve 2 % of the total quantities availabe to them by group of varieties. Within this percentage, the said first processors shall obtain a quantity not exceeding 70 % of their processing capacity, provided that they offer adequate guarantees as to the efficiency and long-term viability of their business.


4. However, Member States may distribute quotas directly to producers if they dispose of the necessary data on production of all producers for the three harvests preceding the last harvest, in relation to varieties and quantities produced and delivered to a processor.


5. When the quotas are allocated as provided for in paragraphs 3 and 4, no account shall be taken in particular, when calculating the reference production, of any quantities of raw tobacco produced in excess of the maximum guaranteed quantities applicable under Regulation (EEC) No 727/70.


Where appropriate, production shall be taken into account only within the limit of the quota allocated during the years taken into consideration.


Article 10


A first processor may not conclude cultivation contracts or be reimbursed the amount of the premium for quantities exceeding the quota allocated to him, or to the producer.


Article 11


Detailed rules for the application of this Title shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23. They shall include the adjustments, as provided for in Article 9 (5), in the method of distribution of the quotas and the preconditions for applying the quotas at the level of the producers, in particular in relation to their previous situations.


TITLE III Measures to convert production


Article 12


1. In order to concentrate supply and adapt it to the qualitative requirements of the market, specific aid equivalent to 10 % of the premium shall be granted where cultivation contracts are concluded between a first processor and a recognized group of producers and where the deliveries covered by such contracts account for the entire output of the members of the group.


2. Specific aid shall be paid to the producers' group for the purpose of improving the organization and orientation of production.


3. Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23. They shall include:


- the definition of producers' groups eligible for specific aid,


- the conditions for recognizing producers' groups,


- the use to which specific aid may be put.


Article 13


1. A Community fund for tobacco research and information shall be set up. It shall be financed from the proceeds of a deduction not exceeding 1 % from the premium at the time of payment.


2. The fund shall finance and coordinate programmes of research and information to promote greater knowledge of the harmful effects of tobacco and the appropriate preventive and curative measures relevant to such effects and to orientate Community tobacco production towards the least harmful varieties and qualities.


3. Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23.


Article 14


A three-year programme for the conversion of plantations of Mavra, Tsebelia, Forchheimer Havanna IIc and hybrids of Geudertheimer tobacco to varieties more in line with market requirements or to other agricultural crops shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23. The programme shall be launched beginning with the 1993 harvest. It may comprise specific measures to compensate growers for any loss of income due to the conversion.


TITLE IV Trade with third countries


Article 15


Except where this Regulation provides otherwise or where the Commission adopts a derogation in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23, the following shall be prohibited in trade with third countries:


(a) the collection of any charge with an effect equivalent to a customs duty;


(b) the application of any quantitative restriction or measure with equivalent effect.


Article 16


1. If, by reason of imports or exports, the Community market in one or more of the products referred to in Article 1 suffers or is liable to suffer serious disturbance which may jeopardize the objectives of Article 39 of the Treaty, appropriate measures may be taken in respect of trade with third countries until the disturbance or threat of disturbance has ceased.


2. If the situation referred to in paragraph 1 arises, the Commission shall, at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, decide on the necessary measures, which shall be notified to the Member States and be immediately applicable. If the Commission receives a request from a Member States it shall take a decision thereon within 24 hours after receipt of the request.


3. The measures taken by the Commission may be referred to the Council by any Member State within three working days of the date of notification. The Council shall meet without delay. It may amend or repeal the measure in question by a qualified majority.


TITLE V General and transitional provisions


Article 17


In order to deal with unforeseen market circumstances, exceptional support measures may be taken in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23. The scope and duration of such measures may not exceed that which is strictly necessary to support the market.

Where adjustments are required the Member State shall make them at the earliest opportunity. Any modification of national arrangements shall be notified without delay by the Member States to the Commission and examined by it in accordance with the same procedure.


2. Each producer Member State shall set up, in accordance with its legal order, a specific agency to carry out certain checks in connection with the Community arrangements for tobacco. However, Member States who have a threshold quantity of less than 45 000 tonnes pursuant to Article (9) 2, may choose not to set up such an agency.


3. The agency shall be given complete administrative autonomy. It shall be given full powers by the Member States concerned to carry out the tasks assigned to it.

Whereas the completion of the internal market will mean controls and formalities at internal frontiers relating to means of transport and the relevant documentation will have to be abolished;


Whereas, pursuant to existing Community and national legislation in the field of road and inland waterway transport, Member States perform checks, verifications and inspections relating to technical characteristics, authorizations and other documentation with which vehicles and inland waterway vessels must comply; whereas there will in general continue to be a need for such checks, verifications and inspections to prevent disruption of transport market organization and to ensure road and inland waterway safety;


Whereas, pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4060/89 of 21 December 1989 on the elimination of controls performed at the frontiers of Member States in the field of road and inland waterway transport (4), such checks shall no longer be performed at frontiers between Member States where they concern means of transport registered or put into circulation in a Member State;


Whereas the same principle should be introduced with regard to the application of the controls laid down in the said Regulation and of controls carried out for the purposes of agreements with third countries to means of transport registered or put into circulation in a third country;


Whereas the authorities of the Member State where the means of transport enter from a third country must continue to be able to carry out all necessary controls with regard to checking that the said means of transport possess the authorization to carry out transport operations on or through its territory;


Whereas Member States must ensure that checks, verifications and inspections can continue to be performed throughout their respective territories as part of the normal control procedures;


Whereas cooperation to fulfil the obligations of this Regulation should follow the rules laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1468/81 of 19 May 1981 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs or agricultural matters (5),

- 'international agreement` shall mean any agreement between one or more Member States or the Community and one or more third countries.


Article 3


The controls referred to in Article 1 shall no longer be performed as border controls at the internal frontiers of the Community, but as part of the controls the Member States would normally carry out throughout their territory.


Article 4


For the purposes of implementing this Regulation, the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 1468/81 shall apply mutatis mutandis. In addition, Member States shall take all the necessary steps to establish cooperation between their respective competent authorities.

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1) ,


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2) ,

4. An air fare may be available for sale and carriage as long as it is not withdrawn in accordance with Article 6 or Article 7.


Article 6


1. Subject to the procedures of this Article, a Member State concerned may decide, at any moment:

(b) to stop, in a non-discriminatory way, further fare decreases in a market, whether on a route or a group of routes, when market forces have led to sustained downward development of air fares deviating significantly from ordinary seasonal pricing movements and resulting in widespread losses among all air carriers concerned for the air services concerned, taking into account the long term fully-allocated relevant costs of the air carriers.


2. A decision taken pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be notified with reasons to the Commission and to all other Member State(s) involved, as well as to the air carrier(s) concerned.


3. If within fourteen days of the date of receiving notification no other Member State concerned or the Commission has notified disagreement stating its reasons on the basis or paragraph 1, the Member State which has taken the decision pursuant to paragraph 1 may instruct the air carrier(s) concerned to withdraw the basic fare or to abstain from further fare decreases, as appropriate.


4. In the case of disagreement, any Member State involved may require consultations to review the situation. The consultations shall take place within 14 days of being requested, unless otherwise agreed.


Article 7


1. At the request of a Member State involved the Commission shall examine whether a decision to act or not to act pursuant to Article 6 complies with the criteria of Article 6 (1). The Member State shall at the same time inform the other Member State(s) concerned and the air carrier(s) concerned. The Commission shall forthwith publish in the Official Journal of the European Communities that the air fare(s) have been submitted for examination.


2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, the Commission may, on the basis of a complaint made by a party with a legitimate interest, investigate whether air fares comply with the criteria of Article 6 (1). The Commission shall forthwith publish in the Official Journal of the European Communities that the air fare(s) have been submitted for examination.


3. An air fare in force at the time of its submission for examination in accordance with paragraph 1 shall remain in force during the examination. However, where the Commission, or the Council in accordance with paragraph 8, has decided within the previous six months that a similar or lower level of the basic fare on the city-pair concerned does not comply with the criteria of Article 6 (1) (a), the air fare shall not remain in force during the examination.


Furthermore, where paragraph 6 has been applied, the air carrier concerned may not, during the examination by the Commission, apply a higher basic fare than the one which was applicable immediately before the basic fare under examination.


4. Following consultations with the Member States concerned, the Commission shall take a decision as soon as possible and in any event not later than twenty working days after having received sufficient information from the air carrier(s) concerned. The Commission shall take into account all information received from interested parties.


5. When an air carrier does not supply the information requested within the time limit fixed by the Commission, or supplies it in incomplete form, the Commission shall be decision require the information to be supplied. The decision shall specify what information is required and fix an appropriate time limit within which it is to be supplied.


6. The Commission may, by decision, decide that an air fare in force shall be withdrawn pending its final determination where an air carrier supplies incorrect information or produces it in incomplete form or does not supply it within the time limit fixed by decision under paragraph 5.


7. The Commission shall without delay communicate its reasoned decision under paragraphs 4 and 6 to the Member State(s) concerned and to the air carrier(s) concerned.


8. A Member State concerned may refer the Commission's decision under paragraph 4 to the Council within a time limit of one month. The Council, acting by a qualified majority, may take a different decision within a period of one month.


9. The Member States concerned shall ensure that the Commission's decision is enforced, unless the decision is under examination by the Council or the Council has taken a different decision in accordance with paragraph 8.


Article 8


At least once a year the Commission shall consult on air fares and related matters with representatives of air transport user organizations in the Community, for which purpose the Commission shall supply appropriate information to participants.

Council Directive 92/34/EEC of 28 April 1992 on the marketing of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production




COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/34/EEC of 28 April 1992 on the marketing of fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants intended for fruit production


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2)


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas fruit production occupies an important place in the agriculture of the Community;


Whereas satisfactory results in the cultivation of fruit depend to a large extent on the quality and plant health of the material used for their propagation and of the fruit plants intended for fruit production; whereas certain Member States have in consequence introduced rules intended to guarantee the quality and plant health of the fruit plant propagating material and fruit plants placed on the market;


Whereas the different treatment accorded to propagating material and fruit plants in different Member States is likely to create barriers to trade and thus hinder the free movement of these goods within the Community; whereas, with a view to achieving the internal market, these barriers should be removed, by adopting Community provisions to replace those laid down by the Member States;


Whereas the establishment of harmonized conditions at Community level will ensure that purchasers throughout the Community receive propagating material and fruit plants which are healthy and of good quality;


Whereas, so far as they relate to plant health, such harmonized conditions must be consistent with Council Directive 77/93/EEC of 21 December 1976 on protective measures against the introduction into the Member States of organisms harmful to plant or plant products (4);


Whereas it is appropriate initially to establish Community rules for those genera and species of fruit plant which are of major economic importance in the Community, with a Community procedure for adding further genera and species later;


Whereas, without prejudice to the plant health provisions of Directive 77/93/EEC, it is not appropriate to apply the Community rules on the marketing of propagating material and fruit plants when it is shown that such products are intended for export to third countries, as the rules applicable there may be different from those contained in this Directive;


Whereas the determination of plant health and quality standards for each genus and species of fruit plant requires lengthy and detailed technical and scientific consideration; whereas a procedure should accordingly be established for that end;


Whereas in the first instance it is the responsibility of the suppliers of propagating material and/or fruit plants to ensure that their products fulfil the conditions laid down in this Directive;


Whereas the competent authorities of the Member States must, when carrying out controls and inspections, ensure that suppliers fulfil those conditions with regard to propagating material or fruit plants belonging to the CAC (Conformitas Agraria Communitatis) category;


Whereas it is indispensable to provide for other categories of propagating material and fruit plants for which the said material and plants must be the subject of official certification;


Whereas Community control measures should be introduced to ensure uniform application in all the Member States of the standards laid down in this Directive;


Whereas it is consistent with current agricultural practice to require that certain propagating material and fruit plants are either officially examined, or are declared virus-free, meaning found free of all known viruses and virus-like pathogens, or again virus-tested, meaning found free of specific viruses and virus-like pathogens reducing the usefulness of the propagating material and fruit plants;


Whereas it is in the interests of the purchasers of propagating materials and fruit plants that the names of varieties be known and that their identity be safeguarded;


Whereas the objective stated above can best be achieved either through common knowledge of the variety or through the availability of a description drawn up and kept by the supplier; whereas in the latter case, however, the propagating material or fruit plants may not obtain access to the categories which are the subject of official certification;


Whereas, in order to ensure the identity and orderly marketing of propagating material and fruit plants, Community rules must be laid down concerning the separation of lots and marking; whereas the labels should give the particulars needed both for official control and for the information of the user;


Whereas rules should be established permitting, in the case of temporary supply difficulties, the marketing of propagating material and fruit plants subject to requirements less stringent than those contained in this Directive;


Whereas, as a first step towards harmonized conditions, Member States should be prohibited in the case of the genera and species referred to in Annex II, for which schedules will be drawn up, from imposing new conditions or restrictions on the marketing, other than those provided for in this Directive;


Whereas provisions should be made for authorizing the marketing, within the Community, of propagating material and fruit plants produced in third countries, provided always that they afford the same guarantees as propagating material and fruit plants produced in the Community and complying with Community rules;


Whereas, in order to harmonize the technical methods of examination used in the Member States and to compare propagating material and fruit plants produced in the Community with those produced in third countries, comparative trials should be carried out to check compliance of such products with the requirements of this Directive;


Whereas, in order to facilitate the effective operation of this Directive, the Commission should be entrusted with the task of adopting measures for its implementation and for the amendment of its Annex; and to provide a procedure to that end involving close cooperation between the Commission and the Member States within a Standing Committee on Propagating Material and Plants of Fruit Genera and Species,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Council Directive 92/6/EEC of 10 February 1992 on the installation and use of speed limitation devices for certain categories of motor vehicles in the Community




COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/6/EEC of 10 February 1992 on the installation and use of speed limitation devices for certain categories of motor vehicles in the Community


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 75 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas one of the objectives of a common transport policy is to lay down common rules applicable to international transport within the Community and to facilitate the circulation of vehicles;


Whereas the growth of road traffic and the resulting increase in danger and nuisance present all Member States with road safety and environmental problems of a serious nature;


Whereas the available engine power for heavy goods vehicles and buses needed for climbing slopes enables them to be driven on level roads at excessive speeds that are not compatible with the specifications of other components of those vehicles such as brakes and tyres; whereas, for that reason and for reasons of environmental protection in certain Member States, speed limitation devices were made compulsory for certain categories of motor vehicles;


Whereas the beneficial effects of speed limitation devices with regard to protection of the environment and energy consumption, the wear and tear of the motor and tyres and road safety will be increased if such devices are in general use;


Whereas the use of speed limitation devices serves no purpose unless the appliances are of a degree of technical perfection such as will provide an adequate guarantee that no fraud is possible;


Whereas, as a first step, requirements should be introduced in the case only of the heaviest categories of motor vehicles which are most involved in international transport and thereafter, depending on technical possibilities and experiences in Member States, could be extended to lighter categories of motor vehicles;


Whereas, in certain Member States, vehicles intended exclusively for the carriage of dangerous goods must be equipped with speed limitation devices set at maximum speeds lower than those provided for by this Directive; whereas, in this specific case, the Member States in question should be allowed to maintain such regulations for vehicles registered within their territory because they enhance road safety and civil protection of the public, in accordance with the objectives of this Directive;


Whereas the installation of speed limitation devices on category M3 and N3 vehicles covered by this Directive, registered before it is brought into effect and intended exclusively for national transport operations could entail excessive costs in certain Member States; whereas it should therefore be made possible for those Member States to postpone the application of Articles 2 and 3 of this Directive to the vehicles concerned;


Whereas this Directive does not affect Member States' prerogatives as regards speed restriction provisions for traffic,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


Article 1


For the purpose of this Directive, 'motor vehicle' means any power-driven vehicle falling within one of the categories listed below, intended for use on the road and having at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h:


- category M3 vehicles having a maximum weight exceeding 10 metric tonnes,


- category N3 vehicles,


categories M3 and N3 being understood to be those defined in Annex I to Directive 70/156/EEC (4).


Article 2


Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure that motor vehicles of the category M3 referred to in Article 1 shall be used on the road only if speed limitation devices are installed for which the maximum speed is set at 100 km/h.


Article 3


1. Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that motor vehicles of category N3 shall be used on the road only if equipped with a device set in such a way that their speed cannot exceed 90 km/h; bearing in mind the technical tolerance which is allowed, at the present state of technology, between the regulating value and the actual speed of traffic, the maximum speed on this device shall be set at 86 km/h.


2. Member States shall be authorized to set the maximum speed of the device at less than 85 km/h in vehicles used exclusively for the carriage of dangerous goods and registered in their territory.


Article 4


1. Articles 2 and 3 shall be applicable to vehicles registered as from 1 January 1994.


2. Articles 2 and 3 shall also be applicable, at the latest from 1 January 1995, to vehicles registered between 1 January 1988 and 1 January 1994.


However, where these vehicles are used exclusively for national transport operations, Articles 2 and 3 may be applied at the latest from 1 January 1996.


Article 5


1. Until Community provisions on these matters are applied, the speed limitation devices referred to in Articles 2 and 3 must satisfy the technical requirements laid down by the competent national authorities.


2. Speed limitation devices shall be installed by workshops or bodies approved by the Member States.


Article 6


The requirements of Articles 2 and 3 do not apply to motor vehicles used by armed forces, civil defence, fire and other emergency services and forces responsible for maintaining public order.


The same shall apply for motor vehicles which:


- by their construction, cannot drive faster than the limits provided for in Articles 2 and 3,


- are used for scientific tests on roads,


- are used only for public services in urban areas.


Article 7


1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 1 October 1993. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof.


When these provisions are adopted by Member States, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication. The procedure for making such reference shall be adopted by Member States.


2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.


Article 8


This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2137/92 of 23 July 1992 concerning the Community scale for the classification of carcases of ovine animals and determining the Community standard quality of fresh or chilled sheep carcases and extending Regulation (EEC) No 338/91


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 of 25 September 1989 on the common organization of the market in the sheepmeat and goatmeat sector (1), and in particular Article 4 (2) thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,


Whereas a carcase classification standard is necessary in order to improve market transparency in this sector;


Whereas the classification must be made on the basis of conformation and the degree of fat cover; whereas the combination of these two criteria enables carcases of ovine animals to be divided into classes; whereas classified carcases must be identified;


Whereas, however, other criteria, in particular weight, meat colour and fat cover, may be used for the classification of carcases of lambs less than 13 kg weight; whereas Member States wishing to use these criteria inform the Commission and other Member States;


Whereas, in order to ensure the uniform application of this Regulation in the Community, provision should be made for on-the-spot checks by a Community inspection group;


Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 338/91 of 5 February 1991 determining the Community standard quality of fresh or chilled sheep carcases (2) applied for the 1991 and 1992 marketing years pending the setting up of Community carcase classification standards;


Whereas it is not appropriate to set up the standards in question at present; whereas it is preferable to first gain some experience, acquired over a sufficiently long period with regard to the application of the classification scale as provided for under this Regulation; whereas it is therefore necessary to extend the application of Regulation (EEC) No 338/91 by a marketing year, with the exception of the measure provided for in Article 7 in Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89, for which the application should be extended until 30 June 1994;


Whereas it appears appropriate to set as an objective the compulsory application of the Community scale after a sufficiently representative transitional period for all the slaughterhouses approved for intra-Community trade; whereas, however, for reasons of sound administration, this compulsory application need not concern small slaugtherhouses situated in regions where the impact on the market price produced by the volume slaughtered in such slaughterhouses is negligible,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


This Regulation governs the provisions concerning the Community scale for the classification of sheep carcases.


Article 2


For the purpose of carcase classification, the following presentations shall apply:


(a) carcase: the whole body of a slaughter animal as presented after bleeding, evisceration and skinning, presented without the head (severed at the atlanto-occipital joint), the feet (severed at the carpo-metacarpal or tarso-metatarsal joints), the tail (severed between the sixth and seventh caudal vertebrae), the udder, the genitalia, the liver and the pluck. Kidneys and kidney fat are included in the carcase;


(b) hall-carcase: the product obtained by separating the carcase symmetrically through the middle of each cervical, dorsal, lumbar and sacral vertebra and through the middle of the sternum and the ischiopublic symphysis.


However, Member States shall be authorized to permit different presentations when the reference presentation is not used. In such instances, the adjustments necessary to progress from those presentations to the reference presentation shall be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89.


Article 3


1. Carcases of ovine animals shall be divided into the following categories:


- carcases of sheep under twelve months old,


- carcase of other sheep.


2. The carcases of ovine animals shall be classified by assessment respectively of:


(a) conformation,


(b) fat cover,


as identified in Annexes I and II respectively.


The conformation class designated in Anenx I by the letter S may be used by the Member States optionally to encompass the higher ('double-muscled carcase type') conformation class. Member States intending to avail themselves of this option shall inform the Commission and the other Member States thereof.


However, for lambs of less than 13 kg carcase weight, Member States may be authorized to use the following criteria for classification:


(a) carcase weight,


(b) colour of meat,


(c) fat cover,


as defined in Annex III. Member States intending to make use of this authorization shall notify the Commission and the other Member States thereof by 5 April 1993.


3. Member States shall authorized to subdivide each of the classes provided for in Annexes I and II into a maximum of three sub-classes.


Article 4


1. Classification of carcases or half-carcases shall take place as soon as possible after slaughter and be carried out in the slaughterhouse itself.


2. The classified carcases or half-carcases shall be identified.


3. The detailed rules for applying this Article shall be adopted by 31 December 1992 in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89.


Article 5


On-the-spot inspection shall be carried out, in collaboration with the competent national authorities, by a Community inspection group composed of experts from the Commission and experts appointed by the Member States. This group shall report back to the Commission and the other Member States on the checks carried out.


If appropriate, the measures necessary for the purpose of classification shall be taken in accordance with the procedures laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89.


The inspections shall be carried out on behalf of the Community, which shall bear the resulting costs.


The detailed rules for applying this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89.


Article 6


Additional provisions specifying the definition of the classes of conformation, fat cover, carcase weight and colour of meat shall be adopted not later than 31 December 1992 in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89.


Article 7


1. From 5 April 1993 and until a new standard quality definition has been introduced, Member States shall on a weekly basis notify the Commission of the market prices recorded for the different classes in the classification scale.


2. The detailed rules for implementing this Article, and in particular the frequency and extent of the recordings, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89.


3. The information notified to the Commission by the Member States shall be used for preparing the report and the proposals provided for in Article 8 (2).


Article 8


1. The text of the second paragraph of Article 2 of Regulation (EEC) No 338/91 shall be replaced by the following:


'It shall apply throughout the 1991, 1992 and 1993 marketing years. However, it shall continue to apply until 30 June 1994 for the purpose of implementing the measure laid dwon in Article 7 of Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89.'


2. The the Commission shall, not later than 31 March 1994, submit a report to the Council, accompanied by a proposal for a definition of standard quality on which the Council shall act by qualified majority and which will enter into force on 1 July 1994 with retroactive effect for the purposes of calculating the ewe premium for the 1994 marketing year.


Article 9


The Commission shall submit a report to the Council on the implementation of this Regulation by 31 December 1995 at the latest.


Subject to the conclusions of that report, the Council shall set itself the goal of making the use of the Community grid compulsory for all Community slaughterhouses approved for intra-Community trade, if possible during the 1996 marketing year and in any event before 1 January 1997, without prejudice to the possibility of excluding small slaughterhouses situated in regions where the impact on the market price produced by the volume slaughtered in such slaughterhouses is negligible.


Article 10


This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.


It shall apply from the 1993 marketing year. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2233/92 of 31 July 1992 laying down detailed rules for the application of the specific premium for the maintenance of dairy herds in the Azores


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 of 15 June 1992 concerning specific measures for the Azores and Madeira relating to certain agricultural products (1), and in particular Article 24 (6) thereof,


Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2205/90 (3), and in particular Article 12 thereof,


Whereas Article 24 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 provides for the granting of specific annual premiums for the maintenance of dairy herds in respect of up to 78 000 head;


Whereas, in order to make verification of applications easier, the Member State in question should take the necessary measures to prevent the premium in question from being used for purposes other than those laid down and whereas there is provision for the Commission staff to be informed as to whether the scheme is working properly;


Whereas the scheme introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92 came into force on 1 July 1992; whereas the detailed rules for its application should take effect on the same date;


Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


1. In accordance with Article 24 of Regulation (EEC) No 1600/92, producers may qualify on application for a specific annual premium for the maintenance of their dairy herds.


2. The aid, amounting to ECU 80 per cow, shall be converted using the agricultural conversion rate applying on the first day of the month in which the premium application is submitted.


3. In order to qualify for the premium, producers must show to the satisfaction of the competent authority that they deliver milk and milk products from the holdings under their management on the day on which the application is submitted.


In addition, the premium shall be granted subject to an undertaking by the recipient to:


- deliver milk and milk products for 12 months from the day on which the application is submitted,


- maintain the number of dairy cows on his holding in respect of which he has submitted a premium application on his holding for a period of 12 months.


Article 2


Portugal shall take all measures necessary to ensure that:


(a) premiums are granted in respect of no more than 78 000 cows;


(b) a single period is fixed each year for the submission of premium applications;


(c) detailed rules are laid down for monitoring the number of cows covered by applications;


(d) other detailed rules, including rules to ensure that premiums are paid solely to dairy farmers, are laid down.

1. Where the number of animals actually shown to be eligible as a result of checks is less than that in respect of which premium applications have been submitted, no premium shall be paid, without prejudice to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.


2. Where the reduction in the number of animals may be ascribed to natural circumstances affecting the life of the herd, premiums shall be paid in respect of the number of animals actually eligible provided that the recipient has notified the competent authority of the circumstances in writing within 10 days of the event in question.


3. Producers shall continue to qualify for the premium in respect of the number of animals actually eligible where they have been unable to fulfil the undertaking laid down in Article 2 for reasons of force majeure. Producers shall notify the competent authorities of the circumstances within 10 days of the event in question.


4. In cases other than those covered by paragraphs 2 and 3, where the difference between the number of animals actually eligible and the declared number is less than 5 % or one head at most if the number of declared animals is equal to or less than 20 head, premiums shall be paid in respect of the number of eligible animals, less 20 %, provided that, in the opinion of the competent authority, no false declaration submitted deliberately or through serious negligence is involved.


5. Amounts paid unduly shall be recovered, plus interest to be determined by the Member State running from the date of payment of the premium until its recovery.


6. Where paragraph 1 is applied, if the competent authority finds that a false declaration made deliberately or through serious negligence is involved, the producer in question shall not be eligible for the premium for 12 months from the date of such finding.


Article 4

COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 2719/92 of 11 September 1992 on the accompanying administrative document for the movement under duty-suspension arrangements of products subject to excise duty


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Directive 92/12/EEC of 25 February 1992 on the general arrangements for products subject to excise duty and on the holding, movement and monitoring of such products (1), and in particular Articles 18 (1) and 19 (1) thereof,


Having regard to the opinion of the Committee on Excise Duties,


Whereas the movement of products subject to excise duty between tax warehouses and between a tax warehouse and a registered or non-registered operator takes place under duty-suspension arrangements; whereas it is necessary to establish in a binding manner the form and content of the accompanying document which might be either an administrative or a commercial document;


Whereas it is also necessary to determine who shall pass on the fourth copy of the accompanying document intended for the competent authorities to those authorities and how this should take place; whereas it is desirable and in line with practice to place this obligation on the consignee in the country of destination, since only he is in a position to make available to his competent authorities this document, which is important for the purposes of the tax supervision, without the danger of it being misdirected; whereas the fourth copy too should carry a certification of receipt, if this is requested by the competent authorities of the Member State of destination, which indicates to those authorities that the goods were received in the consignee's tax warehouse,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


The document shown in the Annex shall be used as the administrative document accompanying the movement under duty-suspension arrangements of products subject to excise duty within the meaning of Article 3 (1) of Council Directive 92/12/EEC. The instructions concerning completion of the document and the procedures for its use are shown on the reverse of copy 1 of this document.


Article 2


1. A commercial document may replace the administrative document provided it contains the same information required to be shown in the administrative document.


2. A commercial document which does not have the same layout as the administrative document must contain the same elements of information required by the administrative document, and the nature of the information items must be identified by a number corresponding to the relative box number on the administrative document.


Article 3


Where products subject to excise duty are moved in fixed pipelines the Member States involved may, by mutual agreement, authorize the type and quantity of goods moved between the consignor tax warehouse and the consignee tax warehouse to be reported by computerized procedures which will replace the accompanying document. Such arrangement should be sufficient to ensure that all the data necessary for inventory control and for collection of duty are provided.


Article 4


The consignee, if required by the competent authorities of the Member State of destination, shall annotate the fourth copy of the accompanying document with the same certification of receipt as on the third copy (copy for return) and shall make it available to the competent authorities to which he reports in accordance with their instructions.


Article 5


This Regulation shall enter into force on 1 January 1993. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

Council Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92 of 14 July 1992 on certificates of specific character for agricultural products and foodstuffs




COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2082/92 of 14 July 1992 on certificates of specific character for agricultural products and foodstuffs


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas the production, manufacture and distribution of agricultural products and foodstuffs play an important role in the Community economy;


Whereas, in the context of the reorientation of the common agricultural policy, the diversification of agricultural production should be encouraged; whereas the promotion of specific products could be of considerable benefit to the rural economy, particularly in less-favoured or remote areas, both by improving the income of farmers and by retaining the rural population in these areas;


Whereas, in the context of the completion of the internal market in foodstuffs, economic operators should be provided with instruments which enable them to enhance the market value of their products while protecting consumers against improper practices and guaranteeing at the same time fair trade;


Whereas, in accordance with the Council resolution of 9 November 1989 on future priorities for relaunching consumer protection policy (4), account should be taken of increasing consumer demand for greater emphasis on quality and information as regards the nature, method of production and processing of foodstuffs and their special characteristics; whereas, given the diversity of products on the market and the abundance of information concerning them, consumers must, in order to be able to make a better choice, be provided with clear and succinct information regarding the specific characteristics of foodstuffs;


Whereas a voluntary system based on regulatory criteria will help attain these aims; whereas such a system enabling producers to make known the quality of a foodstuff throughout the Community must offer every guarantee so that any references which may be made to it in the trade are substantiated;


Whereas certain producers would like to derive market value from the specific character of agricultural products or foodstuffs because their inherent characteristics distinguish them clearly from similar products or foodstuffs; whereas, in order to protect the consumer, the certified specific character should be subject to inspection;


Whereas, given the specific character of such products or foodstuffs, special provisions should be adopted to supplement the labelling rules laid down in Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs (5) and whereas, in particular, an expression and, as appropriate, a Community symbol should be devised to accompany the trade description of such products or foodstuffs informing the consumer that it is a product or foodstuff presenting inspected specific characteristics;


Whereas, to guarantee that agricultural products and foodstuffs consistently possess the certified specific characteristics, groups of producers must themselves define the said characteristics in a product specification but whereas the rules for approving inspection bodies responsible for checking that the product specification is complied with must be uniform throughout the Community;


Whereas, in order not to create unfair conditions of competition, any producer must be able to use either a registered trade description together with details and, where appropriate, a Community symbol or a trade description registered as such, as long as the agricultural product or foodstuff he produces or processes complies with the requirements of the relevant specification and the inspection body he has selected is approved;


Whereas provision should be made for allowing trade with third countries offering equivalent guarantees for the issue and inspection of certificates of specific character in their territory;


Whereas, if they are to be attractive to producers and reliable for consumers, expressions relating to the specific character of an agricultural product or a foodstuff must be granted legal protection and be subject to official inspection;


Whereas a procedure should be provided for to establish close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission in a regulatory committee set up for the purpose,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


1. This Regulation lays down rules under which a Community certificate of specific character may be obtained for:


- agricultural products listed in Annex II to the Treaty and intended for human consumption,


- foodstuffs listed in the Annex to this Regulation.


The Annex may be amended in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 19.


2. This Regulation shall apply without prejudice to other specific Community provisions.


3. Council Directive 83/189/EEC of 28 March 1989 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations (6) shall not apply to certificates of specific character which are the subject of this Regulation.


Article 2


For the purposes of this Regulation:


1. 'specific character` shall mean the feature or set of features which distinguishes an agricultural product or a foodstuff clearly from other similar products or foodstuffs belonging to the same category.


The presentation of an agricultural product or a foodstuff is not regarded as a feature within the meaning of the first subparagraph.


Specific character may not be restricted to qualitative or quantitative composition or to a mode of production laid down in Community or national legislation, in standards set by standardization bodies or in voluntary standards; however, this rule shall not apply where the said legislation or standard has been established in order to define the specific character of a product;


2. 'group` shall mean any association, irrespective of its legal form or composition, of producers and/or processors working with the same agricultural product or foodstuff. Other interested parties may participate in the group;


3. 'certificate of specific character` shall mean recognition by the Community of the specific character of a product by means of its registration in accordance with this Regulation.


Article 3


The Commission shall set up and administer a register of certificates of specific character which will list the names of agricultural products and foodstuffs of which the specific character has been recognized at Community level in accordance with this Regulation.


The register shall distinguish between the names referred to in Article 13 (1) and those referred to in Article 13 (2).


Article 4


1. In order to appear in the register referred to in Article 3, an agricultural product or foodstuff must either be produced using traditional raw materials or be characterized by a traditional composition or a mode of production and/or processing reflecting a traditional type of production and/or processing.


2. Registration shall not be permitted in the case of an agricultural product or foodstuff the specific character of which is due:


(a) to its provenance or geographical origin;


(b) solely to application of a technological innovation.


Article 5


1. To be registered, the name must:


- be specific in itself, or


- express the specific character of the agricultural product or the foodstuff.


2. A name expressing specific character, as referred to in the second indent of paragraph 1, may not be registered if:


- it refers only to claims of a general nature used for a set of agricultural products or foodstuffs, or to those provided for by specific Community legislation,


- it is misleading, such as that, in particular, which refers to an obvious characteristic of the product or does not correspond to the specification or to the consumer's expectations in view of the characteristics of the product.


3. In order to be registered, a specific name as referred to in the first indent of paragraph 1 must be traditional and comply with national provisions or be established by custom.


4. The use of geographical terms shall be authorized in a name not covered by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs (7).


Article 6


1. In order to qualify for a certificate of specific character, an agricultural product or foodstuff must comply with a product specification.


2. The product specification shall include at least:


- the name within the meaning of Article 5, in one or more languages,


- a description of the method of production, including the nature and characteristics of the raw material and/or ingredients used and/or the method of preparation of the agricultural product or the foodstuff, referring to its specific character,


- aspects allowing appraisal of traditional character, within the meaning of Article 4 (1),


- a description of the characteristics of the agricultural product or the foodstuff giving its main physical, chemical, microbiological and/or organoleptic characteristics which relate to the specific character,


- the minimum requirements and inspection procedures to which specific character is subject.


Article 7


1. Only a group shall be entitled to apply for registration of the specific character of an agricultural product or a foodstuff.


2. The application for registration comprising the product specification shall be submitted to the competent authority of the Member State in which the group is established.


3. The competent authority shall forward the application to the Commission if it considers that the requirements of Articles 4, 5 and 6 are fulfilled.


4. No later than the date of entry into force of this Regulation, Member States shall publish the particulars of the competent authorities which they have designated and shall inform the Commission accordingly.

2. The competent authorities of the Member States shall ensure that all persons who can demonstrate a legitimate economic interest are authorized to consult the application referred to in paragraph 1. In addition, and in accordance with the rules in force in the Member States, the said competent authorities may provide access to other parties with a legitimate interest.


3. Within five months of the date of publication referred to in paragraph 1, any natural or legal person legitimately concerned by the registration may object to the intended registration by sending a duly substantiated statement to the competent authorities of the Member State in which that person resides or is established.


4. The competent authorities of the Member States shall adopt the necessary measures to take account of the statement referred to in paragraph 3 within the period laid down. Member States may also submit objections on their own initiative.


Article 9


1. If no objections are notified to the Commission within six months, the Commission shall enter in the register provided for in Article 3 the main points referred to in Article 8 (1) and publish them in the Official Journal of the European Communities.


2. If objections are notified, the Commission shall, within three months, ask the Member States concerned to seek agreement between themselves in accordance with their internal procedures within a further period of three months. If:


(a) such agreement is reached, the Member States in question shall notify the Commission of all the factors which enabled that agreement to be reached and the opinions of the applicant and the objector. If the information received pursuant to Article 6 (2) is unchanged, the Commission shall proceed in accordance with paragraph 1 above. Otherwise, it shall again initiate the procedure laid down in Article 8;


(b) no agreement is reached, the Commission shall decide on the registration in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 19. If a decision is taken to register the specific character, the Commission shall proceed in accordance with paragraph 1 above.

The Member State concerned shall examine the complaint and inform the other Member State of its findings and of any measures taken.


3. In the event of repeated irregularities and the failure of the Member States to come to an agreement, a duly substantiated application must be sent to the Commission.


4. The Commission shall examine the application by consulting the Member States concerned. Where appropriate, the Commission shall take the necessary steps in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 19. These may include cancellation of the registration.


Article 11


1. A Member State may, at the request of a group established in its territory, apply for an amendment to the product specification.


2. The Commission shall ensure that the request for amendment and the applicant's references are published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Article 8 (2), (3) and (4) shall apply.


The competent authorities of the Member State shall ensure that any producer and/or processor applying the product specification for which an amendment has been requested is informed of the publication.


3. Within three months of the date of the publication provided for in paragraph 2, any producer and/or processor applying the product specification for which an amendment has been requested may exercise his right to preserve the initial product specification by forwarding a statement to the competent authority of the Member State in which he is established, which must forward it to the Commission together with its comments, if appropriate.


4.

Article 12


In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 19, the Commission may define a Community symbol which may be used in the labelling, presentation and advertising of agricultural products or foodstuffs carrying a Community certificate of specific character in accordance with this Regulation.

(a) the group so requested in its application for registration;


(b) the procedure referred to in Article 9 (2) (b) does not show that use of the name is lawful, recognized and economically significant for similar agricultural products or foodstuffs.


Article 14


1. Member States shall ensure that at the latest six months following the date of entry into force of this Regulation inspection structures are in place, the function of which shall be to ensure that agricultural products and foodstuffs carrying a certificate of specific character meet the criteria laid down in the specifications.

3. Designated inspection authorities and/or private bodies must offer adequate guarantees of objectivity and impartiality with regard to all producers or processors subject to their control and have permanently at their disposal the qualified staff and resources necessary to carry out inspections of agricultural products and foodstuffs covered by a Community certificate of specific character.

- an indication to be determined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 19,


- where appropriate, the Community symbol, and,


- subject to Article 13 (2), the registered name.


2. A producer using, for the first time after registration, a name reserved pursuant to Article 13 (1) or (2), even if he belongs to the group making the original application, shall in due course notify a designated inspection authority or body of the Member State in which he is established thereof.


3. The designated inspection authority or body shall ensure that the producer complies with the published information before the product is placed on the market.

2. Registered names shall be protected against any practice liable to mislead the public including, inter alia, practices suggesting that the agricultural product or foodstuff is covered by a certificate of specific character issued by the Community.


3. Member States shall inform the Commission and the other Member States of the measures taken.


Article 18


Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that sales descriptions used at national level do not give rise to confusion with names registered and reserved pursuant to Article 13 (2).


Article 19


The Commission shall be assisted by a committee composed of the representatives of the Member States and chaired by the representative of the Commission.


The representative of the Commission shall submit to the committee a draft of the measures to be taken. The committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter. The opinion shall be delivered by the majority laid down in Article 148 (2) of the Treaty in the case of decisions which the Council is required to adopt on a proposal from the Commission. The votes of the representatives of the Member States within the committee shall be weighted in the manner set out in that Article. The chairman shall not vote.


The Commission shall adopt the measures envisaged if they are in accordance with the opinion of the committee.


If the measures envisaged are not in accordance with the opinion of the committee, or if no opinion is delivered, the Commission shall, without delay, submit to the Council a proposal relating to the measures to be taken. The Council shall act by a qualified majority.

Detailed rules for applying this Regulation shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 19.


Article 21


Within five years of the date on which this Regulation enters into force, the Commission shall submit to the Council a report on the application of the Regulation, together with any appropriate proposals.

Council Directive 92/66/EEC of 14 July 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of Newcastle disease




Council Directive 92/66/EEC of 14 July 1992 introducing Community measures for the control of Newcastle disease


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1) ,


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2) ,


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3) ,


Whereas poultry is listed in Annex II of the Treaty and whereas the marketing of poultry constitutes an important source of revenue for the agricultural population;


Whereas, it is necessary to establish at Community level the control measures to be taken in the event of an outbreak of Newcastle disease in order to ensure development of the poultry sector and contribute to the protection of animal health in the Community;


Whereas minimum Community control measures should furthermore be provided for against Newcastle disease to apply to certain other species;


Whereas an outbreak of Newcastle disease can quickly take on epizootic proportions, causing mortality and disturbances on a scale liable to reduce sharply the profitability of farming or poultry as a whole;


Whereas action must be taken as soon as the presence of the disease is suspected so that immediate and effective control measures can be implemented when its presence is confirmed; whereas such measures must be modulated by the competent authorities to take account of whether or not a country carries out a prophylactic vaccination programme in all or part of its territory;


Whereas it is necessary to prevent any spread of the disease as soon as an outbreak occurs, by carefully monitoring movements of animals and the use of products liable to be contaminated, and, where appropriate, by vaccination;


Whereas diagnosis of the disease must be carried out under the auspices of responsible national laboratories, the coordination of which must be ensured by a Community reference laboratory;


Whereas it is necessary to make provision for the Member States which vaccinate to draw up vaccination plans and to inform the Commission and other Member States about those plans;


Whereas Article 4 of Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field(4) applies in the event of the occurrence of Newcastle disease;


Whereas it is appropriate to confer upon the Commission the task of taking the necessary applicatory measures,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


Article 1


Without prejudice to the Community provisions governing intra-Community trade, this Directive defines the Community control measures to be applied in the event of an outbreak of Newcastle disease in:


(a) poultry;


(b) racing pigeons and other birds kept in captivity.


This Directive shall not apply where Newcastle disease is detected in wild birds living freely; however, in that case, the Member State concerned shall inform the Commission of any measure it takes.


Article 2


For the purpose of this Directive, the definitions given in Article 2 of Council Directive 90/539/EEC of 15 October 1990 on animal health conditions governing intra-Community trade in, and imports from third countries of, poultry and hatching eggs(5) shall apply as appropriate.


The following definitions shall also apply:


(a) 'infected poultry' means any poultry:


- in which the presence of Newcastle disease has been officially confirmed following an examination by an approved laboratory, or


- in the case of second and subsequent outbreaks in which clinical symptoms or post-mortem lesions consistent with Newcastle disease are present;


(b) 'poultry suspected of being infected' means any poultry showing clinical signs or post-mortem lesions which are such that the presence of Newcastle disease may reasonably be suspected;

DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES FOR THE CONFIRMATION AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF NEWCASTLE DISEASE The following procedures for the isolation and characterization of Newcastle-disease viruses should be regarded as guidelines and the minima to be applied in the diagnosis of the disease.


The virus responsible for Newcastle disease is the prototype virus of the Paramyxoviridae. At present, there are nine serologically distinguishable groups of Avian Paramyxoviruses, which have been designated PMV-1 to PMV-9. All Newcastle disease viruses are placed in the PMV-1 group. For the purpose of the diagnostic procedures for the confirmation and differential diagnosis of Newcastle disease the following definition shall apply:


'Newcastle disease' means an infection of poultry caused by any avian strain of the paramyxovirus 1 with an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in day-old chicks greater than 0,7.


CHAPTER 1 Sampling and treatment of samples 1. Samples


Cloacal swabs (or faeces) and tracheal swabs from sick birds; faeces or intestinal contents, brain tissue, trachea, lungs, liver, spleen and other obviously affected organs from recently dead birds.


2. Treatment of samples


The organs and tissues listed in paragraph 1 may be pooled, but separate treatment of faecal material is essential. Swabs should be placed in sufficient antibiotic medium to ensure full immersion. Faeces samples and organs should be homogenized (in an enclosed blender or using a pestle and mortar and sterile sand) in antibiotic medium and made to 10-20 % w/v suspensions in the medium. The suspensions should be left for about two hours at ambient temperature (or longer periods at 4 C) and then clarified by centrifugation (e.g. 800 to 1 000 g for 10 minutes).


3. Antibiotic medium


Different laboratories have used various formulations of antibiotic medium with success and laboratories referred to in Annex II will be able to offer advice for a particular country. High concentrations of antibiotics are required for faeces samples and a typical mixture is: 10 000 units/ml penicillin, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, 0,25 mg/ml gentamycin and 5 000 units/ml mycostatin in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) These levels can be reduced up to five-fold for tissues and tracheal swabs. For control of Chlamydia organisms, 50 mg/ml oxytetracycline may be added. It is imperative when making the medium that the pH is checked after the addition of the antibiotics and readjusted to pH 7,0-7,4.


CHAPTER 2 Virus isolation Virus isolation in embryonated fowls' eggs


The clarified supernatent fluid should be inoculated in 0,1-0,2 ml amounts into the allantoic cavity of each of a minimum of four embryonated, fowls' eggs which have been incubated for 8 to 10 days. Ideally, these eggs should be obtained from a specific pathogen-free flock, but when this is impracticable it is acceptable to use eggs obtained from a flock shown to be free of antibodies to Newcastle-disease virus. The inoculated eggs are held at 37 C and candled daily. Eggs with dead or dying embryos as they arise, and all remaining eggs six days after inoculation should be chilled to 4 C and the allantoic-amniotic fluids tested for haemagglutination activity. If no haemagglutination is detected the above procedure is repeated using undiluted allantoic/amniotic fluid as inoculum.


When haemagglutination is detected the presence of bacteria should be excluded by culture. If bacteria are present the fluids may be passed through a 450 nm membrane filter, further antibiotics added and inoculated into embryonated eggs as above.


CHAPTER 3 Differential diagnosis 1. Preliminary differentiation


It is intended that all haemagglutinating viruses should be submitted to the national laboratory referred to in Annex II for full identification, characterization and pathogenicity tests. However, it is important that interim control measures for Newcastle disease aimed at limiting the spread of the virus should be implemented as soon as possible and regional laboratories should be able to identify the presence of Newcastle disease virus. The haemagglutinating fluids should, therefore, be used in an haemagglutination inhibition test as described in Chapters 5 and 6. Positive inhibition 1. e. 24, or more, with the Newcastle disease virus specific polyclonal antiserum of titre known to be at least 29 would serve as preliminary identification enabling the imposition of interim control measures.


2. Confirmatory identification


The national laboratory should undertake full differential diagnosis of any haemagglutinating agent. Confirmation of Newcastle-disease virus would again be by inhibition in haemagglutination inhibition tests with monospecific chicken antisera. Intracerebral pathogenicity index tests as described in Chapter 7 should be carried out on all positive isolates. Pathogenicity indices of greater than 0,7 indicate the presence of virus requiring the full implementation of control measures.


Recent developments in typing Newcastle-disease viruses, particularly monoclonal antibody techniques, has enabled grouping of the strains and isolates. In particular, some monoclonal antibodies are available which are specific for the vaccinal strains used on the territory of the Community and can be employed in simple haemagglutination inhibition tests.


Since live vaccine strains may often be isolated from sampled poultry the advantage of their rapid identification at the national laboratory referred to in Annex II is obvious. Such monoclonal antibodies should be obtained by the Community reference laboratory as referred to in Article 14 and supplied to the national laboratories to enable confirmation of the isolation of vaccinal viruses.


The national laboratories should submit all haemagglutinating agents to the Community reference laboratory.


3. Further typing and characterization of isolates


The Community reference laboratory should receive all haemagglutinating viruses from the national laboratories for further antigenic and genetic studies to enable a greater understanding of the epizootiology of the disease(s) within the Community in keeping with the functions and duties of the reference laboratory.


CHAPTER 4 Rapid tests for detection of Newcastle-disease virus and antibodies Rapid tests for the detection of Newcastle disease virus in vaccinated birds and the detection of antibodies in unvaccinated birds are outlined below:


1. Detection of Newcastle disease virus


Several rapid test that directly detect Newcastle-disease antigens have been employed in the diagnosis of infections in vaccinated birds. Those most commonly used to date are fluorescent antibody tests on longitudinal sections of the trachea and peroxidase antibody tests on the brain. There seems no reason to doubt that other direct antigen detection tests could be applied to Newcastle-disease virus infections.


The drawback to such tests is that it is impracticable to examine all the potential sites of replication of Newcastle-disease virus in the vaccinated birds. So that, for example, absence of evidence of virus in the trachea does not preclude virus replication in the gut. No direct detection method is recommended for routine use in the diagnosis of Newcastle disease, although in specific circumstances such tests may have a useful role.


2. Detection of antibodies in unvaccinated birds


The majority of laboratories involved in Newcastle disease diagnosis are familiar with the haemagglutination inhibition test and the recommendation described below relate to this test for the measurement of antibodies to the virus. However, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Elisa) may be successfully used to detect antibodies to the virus. It is suggested that if there is a wish to employ an Elisa test at regional laboratory level the test should be monitored by the national laboratory referred to in Annex II.


(a) Samples


Blood samples should be taken from all birds if the flock size is less than 20 and from 20 birds from larger flocks (this will give a 99 % probability of detecting at least one positive serum if 25 % or more of the flock is positive, regardless of flock size). The blood should be allowed to clot and serum removed for testing.


(b) Examination for antibodies


Individual serum samples should be tested for their ability to inhibit Newcastle disease virus haemagglutinating antigen in standard haemagglutination inhibition tests as defined in Chapter 6.


There is some debate as to whether 4 or 8 haemagglutinin units should be used for the HI test. It would appear that either is valid and the choice should be left to the discretion of the national laboratories. However, the antigen used will affect the level at which a serum is considered positive: for 4 HAU a positive serum is any showing a titre of 24 or greater and for 8 HAU a positive serum is any showing a titre of 23 or greater.


CHAPTER 5 Haemagglutination (HA) test Reagents


1. Isotonic saline buffered with phosphate (PBS) (0,05 M) to pH 7,0-7,4.


2. Red blood cells (RBC) taken and pooled from a minimum of three specific pathogen free chickens (if not available blood may be taken from birds regularly monitored and shown to be free of NDV antibodies) into an equal volume of Alsever's solution. Cells should be washed three times in PBS before use. For the test a 1 % suspension (packed cell v/v) in PBS is recommended.


3. NDV strain Ulster 2C is recommended for use as standard antigen.


Procedure


(a) Dispense 0,025 ml PBS into each well of a plastic microtitre plate (V-bottomed wells should be used).


(b) Place 0,025 ml of virus suspension (i.e. allantoic fluid) in the first well.


(c) Use a microtitration diluter to make two-fold dilutions (1:2 to 1:4096) of virus across the plate.


(d) Dispense a further 0,025 ml of PBS to each well.


(e) Add 0,025 ml of 1 % red blood cells to each well.


(f) Mix by tapping gently and place at 4 C.


(g) Plates are read 30 - 40 minutes later when controls are settled. Reading is done by tilting the plate and observing the presence or absence of tear-shaped streaming of the RBCs. Wells with no HA should flow at the same rate as the control cells with no virus.


(h) The HA titre is the highest dilution that causes agglutination of the RBCs. That dilution may be regarded as containing one HA unit (HAU). A more accurate method for determining the HA titre is to do HA tests on virus from a close range of initial dilutions i.e. 1:3, 1:4, 1:5, 1:6 etc. This is recommended for the accurate preparation of antigen for haemagglutination inhibition tests (see Chapter 6).


CHAPTER 6 Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test Reagents (see Chapter 5)


(a) Phosphate buffered saline (PBS)


(b) Virus-containing allantoic fluid diluted with PBS to contain 4 or 8 HAU per 0,025 ml.


(c) 1 % chicken RBCs.


(d) Negative control chicken serum.


(e) Positive control serum.


Procedure


(a) Dispense 0,025 ml PBS into all wells of a plastic microtitre plate (with V-bottomed wells).


(b) Place 0,025 ml of serum into first well of plate.


(c) Use microtitration diluter to make two-fold dilutions of serum across plate.


(d) Add 0,025 ml of diluted allantoic fluid containing 4 or 8 HAU.


(e) Mix by tapping and place plate at 4 C for a minimum of 60 minutes or room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes.


(f) Add 0,025 ml 1 % RBCs to all wells.


(g) Mix by gentle tapping and place at 4 C.


(h) Plates are read after 30-40 minutes when control RBCs are settled. This is done by tilting and observing the presence or absence of tear-shaped streaming at the same rate as control wells containing RBCs (0,025 ml) and PBCs (0,05 ml) only.


(i) The HI titre is the highest dilution of antiserum causing complete inhibition of 4 or 8 units of virus (an HA titration to confirm the presence of the required HAU should be included in each test).


(j) The validity of the results is dependent on obtaining a titre of less than 23 for 4 HAU or 22 for 8 HAU with the negative control serum and a titre of within one dilution of the known titre of the positive control serum.


CHAPTER 7 Intracerebral pathogenicity index test 1. Infective freshly harvested allantoic fluid (HA titre must be greater than 24 is diluted 1:10 in sterile isotonic saline (anti-bodies must not be used).


2. 0,05 ml of the diluted virus is injected intracerebrally into each of 10 one-day old chicks (i.e. 24 hours; 40 hours after hatching). The chicks should be hatched from eggs obtained from a specific pathogen-free flock.


3. The birds are examined at intervals of 24 hours for eight days.


4. At each observation each bird is scored: 0 = normal; 1 = sick; 2 = dead.


5. The index is calculated as shown in the following example:


Clinical signs


Day after inoculation


(number of birds)


12345678TotalScore


normal 10 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 14  0 = 0


sick 0 6 10 4 0 0 0 0 20  1 = 20


dead 0 0 0 6 10 10 10 10 46  2 = 92


Total = 112


Index is a mean score per bird per observation = 112/80 = 1,4


CHAPTER 8 Assessment of plaque-forming ability 1. It is usually best to use a dilution range of virus to ensure that an optimum number of plaques are present on the plate. Ten-fold dilutions up to 10-7 in PBS should be sufficient.


2. Confluent monolayers of chick embryo cells or a suitable cell line (Madin-Darby bovine kidney for example) are prepared in 5 cm diameter Petri dishes.


3. 0,2 ml of each virus dilution is added to each of two Petri dishes and the virus allowed to absorb for 30 minutes.


4. After washing three times with PBS the infected cells are overlaid with the relevant medium containing 1 % w/v agar and either 0,01 mg/ml trypsin or no trypsin. It is important that no serum is added to the overlay medium.


5. After 72 hours, incubation at 37 C the plaques should be of sufficient size. They are best seen by removing the agar overlay and staining the cell monolayer with crystal violet (0,5 % w/v) in 25 % v/v ethanol.


6. All viruses should give clear plaques when incubated in the presence of trypsin in the overlay. When trypsin is absent from the overlay only viruses virulent for chickens will produce plaques.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 3002/92 of 16 October 1992 laying down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Regulation No 136/66/EEC of 22 September 1966 on the establishment of a common organization of the market in oils and fats (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2046/92 (2), and in particular Articles 12 (4) and 26 (3) thereof, and to the corresponding provisions of the other Regulations establishing a common organization of agricultural product markets,


Whereas Community rules relating to various sectors covered by the common organization of agricultural markets provide for the application of an intervention system;


Whereas certain products removed from intervention may be subject to a specific use and/or destination; whereas a system of supervision should be set up to ensure that such products are not diverted from their use and/or destination;


Whereas Commission Regulation (EEC) No 569/88 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2919/92 (4), lays down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention; whereas in connection with the suppression of controls and formalities at the internal frontiers and on the occasion of further amendments to Regulation (EEC) No 569/88, and for reasons of clarity and administrative efficiency, the rules concerned should be redrafted;


Whereas in those cases where two or more Member States are involved in the supervision, Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2823/87 of 18 September 1987 on the documents to be used for the purpose of implementing Community measures entailing verification of the use and/or destination of goods (5) should apply;


Whereas other authorities as well as customs authorities competent to issue the control copy T 5 and to verify the use and/or destination of intervention goods have to be designated;


Whereas, for reasons of simplification and efficiency, it is appropriate to stipulate tht the control copy T 5, after the necessary checks have been carried out, has to be sent directly to the agency holding the security, and that where two or more Member States are involved, the control copies T 5 have to be sent directly by each separate Member State to the agency holding the security;


Whereas it seems desirable, in order to simplify administrative procedures, to provide for greater flexibility than is afforded by the control copy in the case of exports in accordance with the system laid down in Title X, Chapter I, of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1214/92 (6) which provides that, when a carriage operation starts within the Community and is to end outside it, no formalities need be carried out at the customs office for the frontier station;


Whereas the disproportionate number of amendments of the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 569/88 make it necessary to delete that Annex and justify the reference to the endorsements stipulated in the specific Regulations;


Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the relevant management committees,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


TITLE I General provisions


Article 1


1. Without prejudice to the specific derogations provided for in the Community rules relating to certain agricultural products, this Regulation lays down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products removed from intervention stock pursuant to:


- Articles 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 136/66/EEC (oils and fats),


- Article 5 and 25 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1418/76 (7) (rice),


- Articles 6 to 9 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 (8) (milk and milk products),


- Article 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 (9) (beef and veal),


- Article 7 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 727/70 (10) (raw tobacco),


- Articles 7, 8 and 28 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 (11) (cereals),


- Article 6 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 (12) (pigmeat),


where such products are subject to a specific use and/or destination.


2. For the purposes of this Regulation, 'dispatch' means the consignment of goods from one Member State to another and 'exportation' means the consignment of goods from a Member State to a destination outside the customs territory of the Community.

ANNEX


Description of goods Classification CN code Reasons (1) (2) (3) 1. A multiplexing system in the form of a central unit, consisting of three printed circuits equipped with a transformer and discrete and hybrid components and a series of sub-units. The multiplexing unit enables serveral different signals to be transmitted at the same time through the same cable. This system, which is fitted to civil aircraft to provide information and entertainment for passengers, allows each passenger to listen through his earphones to any one of several channels. 8517 81 90 Classification is determined by the provisions of general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature, as well as the texts of CN codes 8517, 8517 81 and 8517 81 90. 2. An electronic multiplexing appliance in its own housing which enables multiple link-ups to be made between the different connection points of a computer network. It makes use of digital technology in order to concentrate data and to combine a number of data streams in a single data stream which is transmitted by line. Signals which are received on a single line are, in return, distributed to a number of output lines. 8517 82 00 Classification is determined by the provisions of general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature, as well as the texts of CN codes 8517 and 8517 82 00. 3. A vehicle (length 180 cm, breadth 87 cm, height 100 cm) with a single-cylinder, four-stroke petrol engine (400 cm3 cylinder capacity), it consists essentially of a reinforced hopper with a 400 kg payload, and is equipped with manual tipping device and controls and rubber tracks. It has an unladen weight of 250 kg, a top speed of 6,8 km/h and develops 5,37 kw. The vehicle has three forward speeds and one in reverse. It is intended for transporting and dumping earth, sand, etc. mainly on building sites. 8704 10 19 Classification is determined by the provisions of general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature, as well as the texts of CN codes 8704, 8704 10 and 8704 10 19. By reasons of its design, in particular the presence of both a hopper and rubber tracks, and consequent place of use this vehicle cannot be considered to be covered by CN code 8709. 4. A new vehicle (length 255 cm, breadth 108 cm, height 128 cm) with a single-cylinder, four stroke petrol engine (400 cm3 cylinder capacity), consisting essentially of a reinforced hydraulically-tippable flatbed with gates at the tail and either side, it has a payload of 800 kg, an open driving cab with controls and rubber tracks. It has a top speed of 8,7 km/h, four forward speeds and three in reverse, and develops 7,46 kw. It is intended for transporting and dumping earth, sand, etc. mainly on building sites. 8704 31 91 Classification is determined by the provisions of general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature, as well as the texts of CN codes 8704, 8704 31 and 8704 31 91. By reason of its design, in particular the presence of both a tippable flatbed and rubber tracks, and consequent place of use this vehicle cannot be classified under heading 8709. The versatility and intricate construction of the tippable flatbed prevent this article being considered as a dumper covered by CN code 8704 10. 5. A stand-alone system which enables the operator to create images in two or three dimensions on a screen. It has no other function and cannot be programmed for applications other than computer-aided graphic design.


It comprises the following components:


- a processing unit, including a microprocessor, a graphics processor and a dedicated memory,


- controls, such as a keyboard, mouse, programme function keys and graphic tablet,


- a visual display unit ('stereoscopic screen'). 9017 10 90 Classification is determined by the provisions of general rules 1 and 6 for the interpretation of the combined nomenclature, note 4 to Section XVI, note 5 (B) to Chapter 84 and note 3 to Chapter 90, as well as the texts of CN codes 9017, 9017 10 and 9017 10 90. This product cannot be classified under CN code 8471 because it performs a 'specific function' within the meaning of note 5 (B) to Chapter 84.






Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3615/92 of 15 December 1992 on the determination of the quantities of agricultural products to be taken into account for the calculation of refunds payable in the case of the export of goods referred to in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80




COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 3615/92 of 15 December 1992 on the determination of the quantities of agricultural products to be taken into account for the calculation of refunds payable in the case of the export of goods referred to in Council Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 of 27 June 1968 on the common organization of the market in milk and milk products (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2071/92 (2), and in particular Article 17 (4) thereof, and to the corresponding provisions of the other Regulations on the common organization of agricultural markets referred to in Article 1 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80 of 11 November 1980 laying down for certain agricultural products exported in the form of goods not covered by Annex II to the Treaty, general rules concerning the granting of refunds and the criteria for fixing their amount (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3381/90 (4),


Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80 provides for refunds to be granted on exports of certain agricultural products used in the manufacture of certain goods not covered by Annex II to the Treaty; whereas in respect of exports of goods listed in Annex B to that Regulation, Article 3 thereof provides that the refund may be granted in respect of the quantity of the agricultural product used in the manufacture of the exported goods;


Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80 was adopted in application of certain Council Regulations on the common organization of agricultural markets, including Regulation (EEC) No 804/68; whereas Article 17 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 and the corresponding Articles of the other basic Regulations provide that the difference between prices within the Community and prices on the world market for the agricultural products in question can be covered by a refund to the extent necessary to enable the products to be exported in the form of certain goods not covered by Annex II of the Treaty;


Whereas, in consequence, to qualify for a refund the agricultural products used and in particular the goods manufactured from such products must therefore be exported; whereas any exception to this rule must be given a restrictive meaning;


Whereas, however, during the process of manufacturing the said goods, producers inevitably incur losses of raw materials for which Community prices have nevertheless been paid while the losses incurred by producers established outside the Community are limited to world market prices;


Whereas the concept of products actually used in the process of manufacture of exported goods has received different interpretations in different Member States; whereas the Court of Auditors in its Annual Report (5) made observations concerning the consistent management of losses;


Whereas it is necessary to lay down common rules for determining the concept of the quantity of agricultural products actually used in the process of manufacturing the exported goods;


Whereas during the process of manufacturing certain goods by-products are obtained which differ markedly in value from the principal products; whereas many of these by-products can be used only as animal feed;


Whereas the measures laid down in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of all the management committees concerned,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


For the purposes of implementing Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80:


1. the quantities of agricultural products actually used within the meaning of Article 3 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80 may be declared by reference to a list deposited with the competent authorities of the Member State of manufacture or of export;


2. for the purposes of this Regulation:


(a) 'losses' means the quantities of products or goods resulting from the process of manufacture under consideration, from the stage at which agricultural product are used unprocessed in the manufacture, other than the quantities of goods which are actually exported, other than the residues referred to under (b) and the by-products referred to under (c), and which cannot be commercialized,


(b) 'residues' means the products of the manufacturing process under consideration, of compositions distinctly different from the goods actually exported and which cannot be commercialized,


(c) 'by-products' means the products or goods obtained in the course of the manufacturing process under consideration, of compositions or characteristics distinct from the goods actually exported and which are capable of being marketed;


3. however for the purposes of this Regulation:


(a) the products obtained in the course of the manufacturing process under consideration, of composition distinct from the goods actually exported, sold against a pyment representing exclusively the costs incurred for their disposal, shall not be considered as being marketed,


(b) the products or goods resulting from the manufacturing process under consideration, and which can be disposed of, whether or not against payment, only as animal feeds, shall be assimilated to losses as provided for by point 2 under (a);


4. for the purposes of determining the quantities of agricultural products actually used, the following rules are to be applied:


(a) all agricultural products used within the meaning of Article 3 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80 and which confer a right to a refund but which desappear during the normal course of the manufacturing process (for example as steam or smoke, or by conversion into non-recoverable powder or ash) are eligible for that refund in respect of all of the quantities used,


(b) any quantity of goods which is not actually exported is not eligible for refunds in respect of the quantities of agricultural products actually used, without prejudice of the provisions under (c).


If such goods have the same composition as those actually exported, a pro-rata reduction in quantities of agricultural products actually used in the manufacture of the latter may be applied,


(c) by way of derogation from point (b), losses of 2 % or less by weight inherent in the production of the goods may be taken into account. The threshold of 2 % is calculated as the proportion of the weight of the dry matter of all raw materials used, after deduction of the quantities referred to under (a), in relation to the weight of the dry matter of the actually exported goods, or any other method of calculation appropriate to the conditions of manufacture of the goods. The threshold of 2 % may be replaced by a higher one under the conditions of 5,


(d) where the losses inherent in manufacture exceed 2 % or the specific threshold established in accordance with 5, the excess loss is not eligible for refunds in respect of the quantities of agricultural products actually used.


The competent authority of the Member States may, however, accept justified higher losses. The Member States shall communicate to the Commission the cases to which this is applied,


(e) the actually used quantities of agricultural products incorporated in the residues defined as in 2 (b) shall be taken into account for the granting of refunds,


(f) in the case where by-products are obtained, the quantities of agricultural products actually used shall be attributed respectively to the good exported and to the by-products,


(g) if it is not possible to attribute the agricultural products actually used, respectively, to the goods exported and to the by-products (where appropriate by means of analysis), the case shall be referred to the Commission for its opinion. The Commission shall inform all the Member States of its opinion for harmonized application purposes;


5. the Commission shall progressively establish in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 30 of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 and in the corresponding provisions of the other Regulations on the common organization of agricultural markets referred to in Article 1 of Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80, higher specific thresholds for certain goods on the basis of communications from the Member States and of studies conducted on the usual losses under similar manufacturing conditions for goods intended for the Community market.


Article 2


1. This Regulation shall apply to all export for which, from 1 April 1993, a declaration of agricultural products actually used is submitted, in application of Article 8 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 3035/80. It shall also apply to prior declaration, whether new or renewed, submitted from 1 April 1993.


Any export declaration introduced as from 1 April 1994 referring to a prior declaration of the agricultural products actually used is acceptable, for the application of this Regulation, only if the prior declaration has been introduced, renewed or confirmed as from 1 April 1993.


2. The Member States shall inform the Commission by 1 April 1993 of the measures adopted for the application of this Regulation.


Article 3


This Regulation shall enter into force on the seventh day following its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1156/92 (2), and in particular Article 14 (9) thereof,

Council Regulation (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals




COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1766/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in cereals


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and in particular Articles 42 and 43 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas the prices and guarantees represented by the machinery introduced by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in cereals (4) encourage the growth of cereals production at a rate which is no longer in line with the absorption capacity of the market; whereas, in order to avoid a succession of increasingly serious crises, the current policy should be radically reformed; whereas that implies that the support provided by the market organization should be reorientated in such a way that it no longer depends solely on guaranteed prices;


Whereas the new orientation of the common agricultural policy must lead to better market equilibrium and to a better competitive position for Community agriculture; whereas that objective can be achieved by lowering the target price to a level representing an anticipated rate on a stabilized world market; whereas, so as not to encourage producers to opt for one particular crop, the target price should be the same for the major cereales;


Whereas the loss of income resulting from the drop in prices is offset by direct aid per hectare introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 (5);


Whereas the structure of guaranteed prices must permit disposal of surpluses within the Community; whereas an intervention price should therefore be fixed at a lower level and a threshold price at a higher level than the target price;


Whereas the new structure of guaranteed prices leads to the elimination of the current provisions on derived prices;


Whereas the aid scheme provided for by Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 replaces those for durum wheat and certain minor cereales; whereas those aids should therefore be discontinued;


Whereas the intervention agencies must be able, in special circumstances, to take intervention measures suited to those circumstances; whereas, however, so that the required uniformity of intervention systems may be maintained, those special circumstances should be assessed and the appropriate measures determined at Community level;


Whereas the intervention prices and threshold prices should, in the course of the marketing year, be subject to a certain number of monthly increases in order to take account, to some extent, of storage costs and interest charges for storing cereals in the Community and of the need to ensure that the disposal stocks conforms to market requirements;


Whereas potatoes intended for the production of starch are in direct competition with cereals intended for the production of starch; whereas, in view of the reform measures envisaged for cereals and to ensure equal treatment between the lines of production in question, similar measures should be adopted with regard to potatoes intended for the production of starch;


Whereas the creatin of a single Community market for cereals involves, apart from a system of guaranteed prices, the introduction of a single trading system at the external frontiers of the Community; whereas a trading system including levies and export refunds, combined with intervention measures, also serves to stabilize the Community market, in particular by preventing price fluctuations on the world market from affecting prices ruling within the Community; whereas, therefore, provision should be made for charging a levy on imports from third countries and for the payment of a refund on exports to those countries, both being designed to cover the difference between prices ruling outside and within the Community; whereas, moreover, in respect of products processed from the cereals to which this Regulation applies, account should be taken of the need to ensure a measure of protection for the Community processing industry;


Whereas, in addition to the system described above, and to the extent necessary for its proper working, provision should be made for regulation or, when the situation on the market so requires, prohibiting totally or partially the use of 'inward processing arrangements`;


Whereas the competent authorities must be in a position to monitor trade movements in order to assess market trends and to apply the measures laid down in this Regulation as necessary; whereas, to that end, provision should be made for the issue of import and export licences accompanied by the provision of security guaranteeing that the transactions for which such licences are requested are effected;


Whereas the levy system makes it possible to dispense with all other protective measures at the external frontiers of the Community; whereas, however, the common price and levy machinery may, in exceptional circumstances, prove defective whereas, in such cases, so as not to leave the Community market without defence against disturbances, the Community should be enabled to take all necessary measures without delay;


Whereas, in a situation of high prices on the world market, provision should be made for appropriate measures to be taken in order to safeguard Community supplies and to stabilize prices on Community markets;


Whereas the establishment of a single market based on a common price system would be jeopardized by the granting of certain aids; whereas, therefore, the provisions of the Treaty which allow the assessment of aids granted by Member States and the prohibition of those which are incompatible with the common market should be made to apply to cereals;


Whereas the common organization of the market in cereals must include the products of primary processing which contain cereals or certain products which do not contain cereals but which are directly interchangeable in their use with cereals or with products obtained from cereals;


Whereas, in order to facilitate implementation of the proposed measures, a procedure should be laid down for establishing close cooperation between Member States and the Commission within a Management Committee;


Whereas the common organization of the market in cereals must take appropriate account, at the same time, of the objectives set out in Articles 39 and 110 of the Treaty;


Whereas the expenditure incurred by the Member States as a result of the obligations arising out of the application of this Regulation falls on the Community in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2 and 3 of Council Regulation (EEC) no 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (1);


Whereas the cut in common prices from the time of the entry into force of this Regulation is liable to disrupt the internal market; whereas provision should therefore be made for the possibility for the Commission to take any appropriate measures to avoid such disruptions;


Whereas, since their consolidation by Regulation (EEC) No 2727/75, several provisions concerning the organization of the market in cereals have been amended a number of times; whereas, by reason of their number, their complexity and their dispersal among various Official Journals, these texts are difficult to use and thus lack the clarity which should be an essential feature of all legislation; whereas they should, therefore, be updated,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1

(b) increased, where appropriate, for processed products which contain both basic products listed in Article 1 (1) (a) and other products, by the amount of the incidence on their prime cost of the levies or customs duties charged on those other products;


(c) fixed, for products which do not contain any basic products listed in Article 1 (1) (a), with reference to market conditions for those Article 1 products which are in competition with them;


B. A fixed component designed to protect the processing industry.


2. Where actual offers from third countries of products referred to in Article 1 (1) (d) do not correspond to the price which results from the price of basic products used in their manufacture plus processing costs, an amount fixed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 may be added to the levy fixed in accordance with paragraph 1.

In this case, a premium, fixed at the same time as the levy, shall be added to the levy.


3. A decision may be taken, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23, to apply the provisions of paragraph 2, in whole or in part, to any of the products listed in Article 1 (1) (c) and (d).

4. The scale of premiums shall be fixed by the Commission.


5. Where examination of the market situation shows that the application of the provisions concerning the advance fixing of the levy has given rise, or may give rise, to difficulties, a decision may be taken, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 to suspend the application of those provisions for the period strictly necessary.


In cases of extreme urgency, the Commission may, after examination of the situation on the basis of all the information available to it, decide to suspend advance fixing for a maximum of three working days.


Applications for licences accompanied by applications for advance fixing lodged during the period of suspension shall be rejected.


6. Detailed rules for the application of this Article, and in particular those for advance fixing, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23.

4. However, in the case of products listed in Article 1 (1) (a) and (b), the refund applicable on the day on which application for the licence is lodged, adjusted for the threshold price which will be in force during the month of exportation, shall be applied to an export to be effected during the period of validity of the licence if the applicant so requests when applying for the licence.


A corrective amount may be fixed. It shall be applied to refunds fixed in advance. The corrective amount shall be fixed at the same time as refund according to the same procedure; however, where necessary the Commission may, at the request of a Member State or on its own initiative, alter the corrective amounts in the intervening period.


The provisions of the first and second subparagraphs may be applied, in whole or in part, to any of the products listed in Article 1 (1) (c) and (d) and to any products listed in Article 1 which are exported in the form of goods specified in Annex B.

The Commission, acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 shall lay down the detailed rules needed for this adaptation.


6. Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23. Annex B shall be amended in accordance with the same procedure.

Council Regulation (EEC) No 2083/92 of 14 July 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs




COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2083/92 of 14 July 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas Article 11 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 (4) stipulates that, as from 23 July 1992, products which are imported from a third country may be marketed only where they originate in a third country appearing in a list to be drawn up in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14 of the said Regulation; whereas Article 11 (2) specifies the conditions which have to be met for a third country to be inlcuded in the list;


Whereas it has become apparent that, due to the absence of information submitted to date by third countries, it will not be possible to decide on the entry of those countries in the list within the abovementioned time limit;


Whereas the second subparagraph of Article 16 (3) of the Regulation provides for the possibility to delay the implementation of Article 11 only where a third country has submitted a request for entry in the list in due time before the abovementioned time limit;


Whereas these provisions could lead to interruption of imports of products where a third country has not submitted in due time a request for entry in the list referred to in Article 11 (1) (a);


Whereas interruptions of imports from third countries of products satisfying the conditions specified in Article 11 (2) should be avoided, in particular because these products may be necessary for the proper preparation of composite products;


Whereas, therefore, pending the inclusion of a third country in the list referred to in Article 11 (1) (a), importers should be able to obtain authorization to import from third countries products shown to comply with production rules and inspection arrangements equivalent to those provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 is hereby amended as follows:


1. the following paragraph shall be added to Article 11:


'6. (a) By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the importer(s) in a Member State shall be authorized by the competent authority of the Member State to market until 31 July 1995, products imported from a third country not included in the list referred to in paragraph 1 (a) provided the importer(s) furnish(es) the competent authority of the importing Member State with sufficient evidence that the imported products were manufactured according to production rules equivalent to those laid down in Articles 6 and 7 and were subject to inspection measures of equivalent effectiveness to those referred to in Articles 8 and 9, and that such inspection measures will be permanently and effectively applied.


Such authorization shall be valid only as long as the abovementioned conditions are shown to be satisfied. It shall expire from the time of inclusion of a third country in the list referred to in paragraph 1 (a).


(b) Where a Member State has received sufficient evidence from an importer, it shall forthwith notify to the Commission and the other Member States the third country from which products are imported and supply detailed information on the production and inspection arrangements and the guarantees that they will be pemanently and effectively applied.


(c) At the request of a Member State or at the Commission's initiative, the matter shall be submitted to the Committee referred to in Article 14 for examination. Should it emerge from this examination that the imported products were not manufactured according to equivalent production rules and/or inspection measures of equivalent effectiveness, the Commission shall request the Member State which granted the authorization to withdraw it. It may be decided, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14, that the imports in question shall be prohibited or that their continuation shall be subject to certain of the import conditions being amended within a given period.


(d) The notification referred to in (b) shall not be required where it concerns production and inspection arrangements already notified by another Member State, pursuant to (b), unless significant new evidence is submitted justifying a review of the examination and decision referred to in (c).


Before 31 July 1994, the Commission shall re-examine the provisions of paragraph 1 and submit any appropriate proposal for its review.';


2. the first subparagraph of Article 16 (3) shall be replaced by the following:


'3. Article 5, Article 8 (1) and Article 11 (1) shall apply from 1 January 1993.';


3. the dates referred to in Article 5 (9) and Article 10 (7) shall be replaced by that of 31 July 1994.


Article 2


This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

Council Directive 92/35/EEC of 29 April 1992 laying down control rules and measures to combat African horse sickness




COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/35/EEC of 29 April 1992 laying down control rules and measures to combat African horse sickness


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and in particular Article 43 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and import from third countries of equidae (4) seeks to liberalize the movement of equidae on Community territory; whereas, under Article 5 (4) thereof, Community measures must be introduced to harmonize rules for controlling and measures to combat African horse sickness;


Whereas such measures will make it possible to ensure rational development of the farming sector and contribute to the protection of animal health in the Community;


Whereas an outbreak of this disease can quickly assume epizootic proportions, causing mortality and disturbance which may severely reduce the profitability of livestock production;


Whereas control measures must be taken as soon as the presence of the disease is suspected and whereas immediate and effective action must be implemented as soon as it is confirmed in order to guarantee animal health protection in the Community;


Whereas the measures to be taken must aim at preventing the spread of African horse sickness; whereas the movement of animals liable to transmit the infection must be strictly controlled and insects must be eradicated from infected holdings;


Whereas the conditions under which vaccination against African horse sickness may be carried out and the rules governing such vaccination must be specified;


Whereas, in order to ensure more effective control of the disease, action should be taken to establish protection and surveillance zones, taking into account geographical, administrative, ecological and epizootiological factors;


Whereas a thorough epizootiological inquiry is essential in order to prevent any spread of the disease;


Whereas Article 3 of Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field (5) applies in the event of the occurrence of African horse sickness,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

The competent authority shall inform the Commission thereof;


(e) carry out an epizootiological enquiry in accordance with Article 7.


2. The competent authority may extend the measures provided for in paragraph 1 beyond the zone referred to in point (c) thereof if, on account of the geographical, ecological or meteorological situation or of movements to or from the holding where the disease has been confirmed, there are grounds for suspecting an extension of African horse sickness. It shall inform the Commission accordingly.


3. Where the zone referred to in paragraph 1 is situated in the territory of more than one Member State the competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall collaborate in defining this zone. If necessary, the latter shall be defined under the procedure laid down in Article 19.


Article 7


1. The epizootiological inquiry shall cover:

COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 3149/92 of 29 October 1992 laying down detailed rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks for the benefit of the most deprived persons in the Community


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3730/87 of 10 December 1987 laying down the general rules for the supply of food from intervention stocks to designated organizations for distribution to the most deprived persons in the Community (1), and in particular Article 6 thereof,


Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 of 11 June 1985 on the value of the unit of account and the conversion rates to be applied for the purposes of the common agricultural policy (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2205/90 (3), and in particular Articles 2 (4) and 12 thereof,


Whereas, in view of the experience of a number of years' management of the arrangements introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 3730/87, the implementing rules laid down by Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3744/87 (4), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 583/91 (5), should be amended; whereas, for the sake of clarity and convenience, the latter should be replaced by this Regulation;


Whereas the procedure and rules for establishing the annual distribution plan for products from intervention stocks drawn up by the Commission on the basis of information provided by the Member States should be simplified and the timetable should be adapted taking into account the requirements of distribution to the recipients and the need for financial management of public intervention stocks;


Whereas the supply of agricultural products and foodstuffs to the most deprived persons in the Community normally involves products processed or packaged from products withdrawn from Community intervention stores; whereas, however, the objective may also be achieved by the supply of agricultural products and foodstuffs beloging to the same category of products placed on the Community market; whereas in such cases supply is reimbursed in the form of a withdrawal and transfer of products from the intervention stores;


Whereas, in order to manage the arrangements properly, when apply concerns products which have been processed or subject to a specific operation, there should be a call for tenders to determine the most favourable terms for the supply;


Whereas the terms for reimbursing charitable organizations for costs incurred by the transport of products and also, if appropriate, administrative costs should be determined, within the limits of available funds; whereas transport costs are to be reimbursed on the basis of standards rates; whereas, however, provision should be made for the possibility of determing such transport costs by an invitation to tender; whereas the rules for entering in the accounts the value of products withdrawn from intervention stores for the purposes of EAGGF, Guarantee Section, expenditure should also be laid down, along with the rules to be applied in the even that stocks are transferred from one Member State to another;


Whereas the rates to be applied on the one hand for the conversion of the accounting value of the products, and on the other, for the conversion of transport and administrative costs should be determined; whereas in respect of these costs, in order to avoid currency distortions, a rate closer to economic reality than the agricultural conversion rate should be used, while applying the correcting factor referred to in Article 2 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85; wereas Article 3a of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3152/85 (6), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3237/90 (7), on detailed rules for the application of Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85, provides for such a rate to be published;


Whereas the purpose of these arrangements and the nature of the intervention product transfers justifies the non-application of the monetary compensatory amounts and, where necessary, the rules for applying the supplementary trade mechanism provided for by the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal;


Whereas provision should be made for this Regulation to apply at the beginning of the period of execution of the distribution plan, namely 1 October 1992;


Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the relevant management committees,

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/65/EEC of 13 July 1992 laying down animal health requirements governing trade in and imports into the Community of animals, semen, ova and embryos not subject to animal health requirements laid down in specific Community rules referred to in Annex A (I) to Directive 90/425/EEC


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,


Having regard to the proposals from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas live animals and products of animal origin are included in the list of products in Annex II to the Treaty; whereas the placing on the market of such animals and products constitutes a source of income for part of the farming population;


Whereas in order to ensure the rational development in this sector and increase productivity, animal health rules for the animals and products should be laid down at Community level;


Whereas the Community must adopt the measures intended to establish the internal market progressively over a period expiring on 31 December 1992;


Whereas in view of the abovementioned objectives the Council has laid down animals health rules applicable to cattle, swine, sheep and goats, equidae, poultry and hatching eggs, fish and fish products, bivalve molluscs, semen of bulls and boars, ovine embryos, fresh meat, poultrymeat, meat products, game meat and rabbit meat;


Whereas animal health rules should be adopted for the placing on the market of animals and products of animal origin which are not yet covered by the abovementioned rules;


Whereas provision should be made for applying this Directive without prejudice to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3626/82 of 3 December 1982 on the implementation in the Community of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (4);


Whereas, as regards certain technical aspects, reference must be made to Council Directive 64/432/EEC of 26 June 1964 on animal health problems affecting intra-Community trade in bovine animals and swine (5) and Directive 85/511/EEC of 18 November 1985 introducing Community measures for the control of foot-and-mouth disease (6);


Whereas, in respect of the organization of checks and the follow-up thereto, as well as the safeguard measures to be implemented, reference must be made to the general rules laid down in Council Directive 90/425/EEC of 26 June 1990 concerning veterinary and zootechnical checks applicable in intra-Community trade in certain live animals and products with a view to the completion of the internal market (7);


Whereas, save where otherwise provided, trade in animals and products of animal origin must be liberalized, without prejudice to recourse to possible safeguard measures;


Whereas, given the significant risk of the spread of diseases to which animals are exposed, for certain animals and products of animal origin particular requirements should be specified to be imposed when they are placed on the market for the purposes of trade, particularly when intended for regions with a high health status;


Whereas the specific situation pertaining in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and in Ireland given the insular position of those countries, and the fact that they have been free of rabies for a considerable period of time, warrants particular provisions to ensure that the placing on the market in the United Kingdom and Ireland of dogs and cats which do not originate in those countries does not involve a risk of introducing rabies into those States, without however affecting the abolition of veterinary checks at the frontiers between Member States;


Whereas a health certificate is the most appropriate means of guaranteeing and monitoring compliance with these requirements;


Whereas, to maintain the health situation in the Community, when the animals and products of animal origin referred to in this Directive are placed on the market, they should be made subject to the minimum requirements laid down for trade and compliance therewith monitored in accordance with the principles and rules laid down in Council Directive 90/675/EEC of 10 December 1990 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (8);


Whereas provision should be made for a procedure establishing close co-operation between the Member States and the Commission within the Standing Veterinary Committee;


Whereas the deadline for transposition into national law, set at 1 January 1994 in Article 29, should not affect the abolition of veterinary checks at frontiers on 1 January 1993,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

Council Directive 92/22/EEC of 31 March 1992 on safety glazing and glazing materials on motor vehicles and their trailers




COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/22/EEC of 31 March 1992 on safety glazing and glazing materials on motor vehicles and their trailers


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas measures should be adopted with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992; whereas the internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured;


Whereas the total-harmonization method will be essential in order fully to achieve the single market;


Whereas this method will have to be used at the time of the revision of the entire EEC type-approval procedure, taking account of the spirit of the Council resolution of 7 May 1985 concerning a new approach to the question of technical harmonization and standardization;


Whereas the requirements relating to safety glazing differ from one Member State to another; whereas it is consequently necessary for the same requirements to be adopted by all of the Member States, either in addition to or in place of the existing rules, in order, in particular, to permit implementation, for each type of vehicle, of the EEC type-approval procedure covered by Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (4), as last amended by Directive 87/403/EEC (5);


Whereas any rules on safety glazing shall contain not only requirements relating to its structure but also to its fitting to vehicles;


Whereas by means of a harmonized procedure for the component type-approval of safety glazing, each Member State shall be able to confirm compliance with common requirements relating to manufacture and testing and to inform the other Member States of any such confirmation by forwarding a copy of the component type-approval certificate drawn up for each type of safety glazing; whereas the affixing of an EEC component type-approval mark to any type of safety glazing that conforme to the type that has been component type-approved means that the official testing of that type of glazing in other Member States is no longer justified;


Whereas the safety aspect of windscreens is especially important since, more than in the case of other types of glazing, they are likely to be subjected to violent impact either as a result of collisions or where there are external shocks and can thus be the cause of serious bodily injury; whereas, while aiming at the approximation of the laws of the Member States, the differences between which raise barriers to trade, the solution to be adopted must take account of the safety requirements of road traffic and the need to improve same,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


Article 1


1. Member States shall type-approve any type of safety glazing within the scope defined in Section 1 of Annex I that meets the structural and testing requirements.


2. Member States shall grant whole-vehicle type approval to any vehicle that complies with the fitting requirements laid down in Annex III.


3. The Member State which has granted EEC component type-approval shall take the necessary measures to verify, insofar as is necessary and if need be in cooperation with the competent authorities of the other Member States, that production models conform to the approved type.


Article 2


All applications for EEC component type-approval shall be made by the manufacturer or his authorized representative in a Member State. That Member State shall issue to the manufacturer or his authorized representative an EEC component type-approval mark in compliance with items 4.4 to 4.7 of Annex II for each type of safety glazing that it type-approves in pursuance of Article 1.


Member States shall take all necessary measures to prevent the use of any marks liable to create confusion between items of safety glazing that have already been component type-approved pursuant to Article 1.


Article 3


The competent authorities in each Member State shall, within one month, send to the competent authorities of the other Member States a copy of the component type-approval certificate drawn up for each type of safety glazing and with regard to its fitting, for each type of vehicle to which they grant whole-vehicle type-approval.


Article 4


No Member State may prohibit the marketing or use of safety glazing on grounds relating to its construction where that glazing bears the EEC component type-approval mark.


Article 5


1. If the Member State which has granted EEC component type-approval finds that a number of items of safety glazing bearing the same component type-approval mark do not conform to the approved type, it shall take the necessary measures to ensure that production models do so conform. The competent authorities of that State shall advise those of the other Member States of the measures taken, which may, where necessary, extend to withdrawal of EEC component type-approval. The said authorities shall take like measures if they are informed by the competent authorities of another Member State of such failure to conform.


2. The competent authorities of the Member States shall inform each other, within one month, of any withdrawal of EEC component type-approval, and of the reasons for such a measure.


3. If the Member State which has granted EEC component type-approval disputes the failure to conform notified to it, the Member States concerned shall endeavour to settle the dispute. The Community shall be kept informed and shall, where necessary, hold appropriate consultations for the purpose of reaching a settlement.


Article 6


Any decision taken pursuant to the provisions adopted in implementation of this Directive to refuse or withdraw component type-approval, or prohibit sale and use, shall state in detail the reasons on which it is based. Such decision shall be notified to the party concerned, who shall at the same time be informed of the remedies available to him under the laws in force in the Member States and of the time-limits allowed for the exercise of such remedies.


Article 7


No Member State may refuse EEC whole-vehicle type-approval or national type-approval of a type of vehicle, or refuse or prohibit the sale, entry into service or use of a vehicle, on grounds relating to its safety glazing if this bears the EEC component type-approval mark and if it has been fitted in accordance with the requirements set out in Annex III.


Article 8


For the purposes of this Directive, 'vehicle' means any motor vehicle intended for use on the road, having at least four wheels and a maximum design speed exceeding 25 km/h as well as its trailer, with the exception of vehicles which run on rails, agricultural and forestry tractors or machinery, and construction plant and equipment.


The international classification of these vehicles shall be as set out in Note (b) of Annex I to Directive 70/156/EEC.


Article 9


Any amendments necessary to adapt the requirements of the Annexes to technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13 of Directive 70/156/EEC.


Article 10


1. Member States shall adopt and publish the provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 1 July 1992 and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.


When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such a reference shall be laid down by the Member States.


They shall apply these provisions from 1 October 1992.


2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.


Article 11


This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

2. DEFINITIONS


For the purposes of this Directive:


2.1. Glazing means a pane of glass consisting of a single sheet of glass having undergone a special treatment intended to increase its mechanical strength and limit its fragmentation when smashed.


2.2. Laminated glazing means: at least two sheets of glass held together by at least one sheet of plastic material that is sandwiched between them; that laminated glass may be:


2.2.1. ordinary if none of the sheets of glass of which it consists has been treated; or


2.2.2. treated if at least one of the sheets of glass of which it consists has undergone a special treatment intended to increase its mechanical strength and to limit its fragmentation when smashed.


2.3. Safety glazing coated with plastic means: glazing as defined in item 2.1 or 2.2 with a coating of plastic material on its inner surface.


2.4. Plastic-glass safety glazing means laminated glazing having a single sheet of glass and one or several sheets of plastic laid one on top of the other, at least one of which serves as a sandwich layer. The sheet(s) of plastic is (are) located on the inner surface when the glazing is fitted to the vehicle.


2.5. Surface made entirely of plastic material: means a transparent surface manufactured entirely of organic polymeric material.


2.6. Group of windscreens means a group consisting of windscreens having different shapes and dimensions which are subjected to an examination of their mechanical properties, fragmentation characteristics and their behaviour during tests on their resistance to attack from their environment;


2.6.1. flat windscreen means a windscreen which does not have a nominal curvature represented by a segment height of more than 10 mm per linear metre;


2.6.2. curved windscreen means a windscreen having a nominal curvature represented by a segment height of more than 10 mm per linear metre.


2.7. Double window means a unit consisting of two panes fitted separately into the same aperture on the vehicle.


2.8. Double glazing means a unit consisting of two panes assembled at the factory in a permanent manner and separated by a uniform space;


2.8.1. symmetrical double glazing means double glazing in which the two constituent panes are of the same type (toughened, laminated, etc.) and have the same main and secondary characteristics;


2.8.2. assymetrical double glazing means double glazing in which the two constituent panes are of a different type (toughened, laminated, etc.) or have different main and/or secondary characteristics.


2.9. Main characteristic means a characteristic which significantly alters the optical and/or mechanical properties of a pane of glass with regard to the function that that glass is to perform on the vehicle. This term also includes the trade name or manufacturer's mark.


2.10. Secondary characteristic means a characteristic which is likely to alter the optical and/or mechanical properties of a unit of glazing in a manner that is significant for the function for which it is intended on the vehicle. Account shall be taken of the indices of difficulty when the extent of the alteration is estimated.


2.11. Indices of difficulty means a classification into two degrees that are applicable to the variations observed in practice for each secondary characteristic. The transition from index 1 to index 2 is an indication of the need to carry out traditional tests.


2.12. Developed area of a windscreen means the area of the minimum rectangle of glass from which a windscreen can be made.


2.13. Rake angle of a windscreen means the angle formed by the vertical line and the straight line joining the upper and lower edges of the windscreen, these straight lines being taken in a vertical plane containing the longitudinal access of the vehicle;


2.13.1. the rake angle is measured on a vehicle on the ground and, where the vehicle is used to carry passengers, that vehicle must be in running order, with a full complement of fuel, liquid coolant and lubricant, with tools and spare wheels in place (if these are considered to form part of the standard equipment by the vehicle's manufacturer); account shall be taken of the weight of the driver and, where vehicles are intended to carry additional passengers, of the weight of a passenger on the front seat, the driver and passenger each being taken to a 75  1 kg;


2.13.2. where vehicles are fitted with hydropneumatic, hydraulic or pneumatic suspension or with a device automatically regulating ground clearance as a function of load they shall be tested under the normal operating conditions specified by the manufacturer.


2.14. Segment height h means the maximum distance separating the internal surface of a unit of glazing from a plane passing through the edges of that unit. This distance shall be measured in a direction which is practically normal to the glazing (see Annex II M, Figure 1).

2.15.1. although a change in the main characteristics means a new type of product, in certain cases it is accepted that a change in shape and dimensions does not necessarily involve an obligation to carry out a full series of tests. For certain of the tests specified in the separate Annexes glazing units may be grouped together if it is clear that they have similar main characteristics;


2.15.2. glazing units only having different secondary characteristics may be considered to be of the same type; however, certain tests can be carried out on samples of such glazing if those tests are explicitly stipulated in the test conditions.


2.16. Type of vehicle, as regards the fitting of safety glazing, means vehicles which do not show any essential differences, in particular as regards the type of glazing defined in item 2.15 and fitted on the vehicle.


2.17. Curver means the approximate value of the smallest radius of the arc of the windscreen measured at its most inwardly curved part.

Measure the light scattered by the abraided track at a minimum of four equally-spaced points along the track in accordance with the formula above. Average results for each test piece. In lieu of the four measurements an average value may be obtained by rotating the piece uniformly at three rev/sec or more.


4.5.

9.2.1.1.


Definitions


9.2.1.1.1.


Optical deviation: the angle between the true and apparent direction of a point viewed through the safety-glass pane, the magnitude of the angle being a function of the angle of incidence of the line of sight, the thickness and inclination of the glass pane and the radius of curvature at the point of incidence.


9.2.1.1.2.


Optical distortion in a direction MM%amp% prime;: the algebraic difference in angular deviation AE measured between two points M and M%amp% prime; on the surface of the safety-glass pane, the distance between the two points being such that their projections in a plane at right angles to the direction of vision are separated by a given distance AEx (see Figure 6).


Anti-clockwise deviation should be regarded as positive and clockwise deviation as negative.


9.2.1.1.3.


Optical distortion at a point M: the optical-distortion maximum for all directions MM%amp% prime; from the point M.


9.2.1.2.


Apparatus


This method entails the projection of an appropriate slide (raster) onto the display screen through the safety-glass pane being tested. The change caused in the shape of the projected image by the insertion of the safety-glass pane in the line of sight provides a measure of the distortion. The apparatus shall comprise the following items, arranged as shown in Figure 9.


Notes: AEa = 1-2, i.e. the optical distortion in the direction MM%amp% prime;.


AEx = MC i.e. the distance between two straight lines parallel to the direction of vision and passing through the points M and M%amp% prime;.

Projector, of good quality, with a high-intensity point light source, having for example the following characteristics:


- focal length of at least 90 mm,


- aperture approximately 1/2,5,

9.2.1.3.


Procedure


9.2.1.3.1.


General


Mount the safety-glass pane on the support stand (item 9.2.1.3.2) at the specified rake angle. Project the test image through the area being examined. Rotate the safety-glass pane or move it either horizontally or vertically in order to examine the whole of the specified area.


9.2.1.3.2.


Assessment using a checking template


Where a rapid assessment with a possible margin of error of up to 20 % is sufficient, calculate the value of A (see Figure 10) from the limit value AEL for the change in deviation and the value of R2, for the distance from the safety-glass pane to the display screen:


A = 0,145 AEL  R2


The relationship between the change in diameter of the projected image AEd and the change in angular deviation AE is given by:


AEd = 0,29 AE  R2


where:


AEd is in millimeters,


A is in millimeters,


AEL is in minutes of an arc,


AE is in minuts of an arc,


R2 is in metres.


9.2.1.3.3.


Measurements using a photoelectric device


Where a precise measurement with a possible margin of error of less than 10 % of the limit value is required, measure AEd on the projection axis, the value of the spot width being taken at the point where the luminance is 0,5 times the maximum spot-luminance value.


9.2.1.4.


Expression of results


Evaluate the optical distortion of the safety-glass panes by measuring AEd at any point on the surface and in all directions in order to find AEd max.


9.2.1.5.


Alternative method


In addition, a strioscopic technique is permitted as an alternative to the projection techniques, provided that the accuracy of the measurements given in items 9.2.1.3.2 and 9.2.1.3.3 is maintained.

9.2.5.2.


In the case of category M and N vehicles other than those in category M1, the zones are defined starting from:


9.2.5.2.1.


an ocular point normal to the R point for the driver's seat and 625 mm above that point in the vertical plane parallel to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle for which the windscreen is intended, and passing through the axis of the steering wheel. This point is designated by O below;


9.2.5.2.2.


a line OQ, this being the horizontal straight line passing through ocular point O and running normal to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle.


9.2.5.2.3.


Zone I - the zone of the windscreen bounded by the intersection of the windscreen with the four following planes:


P1 - a vertical plane passing through the O point and forming an angle of 15o to the left of the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle;


P2 - a vertical plane symmetrical to P1 in relation to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle.


If such an arrangement is impossible (absence of median longitudinal plane of symmetry, for example), the plane symmetrical to P1 in relation to the longitudinal plane of the vehicle passing through the A point is taken to be P2;


P3 - a plane containing right angle OQ and forming an angle of 10o above the horizontal plane;


P4 - a plane containing straight line OQ and forming an angle of 8o below the horizontal plane.

Secondary-image-separation test


9.3.1.


Scope


Two test methods are recognidzed:


- target test, and


- collimator-telescope test.


These tests may be used for component type-approval, quality control or product evaluation purposes, as appropriate.


9.3.1.1.


Target test


9.3.1.1.1.


Apparatus


This method involves viewing an illuminated target through the safety-glass pane. The target may be designed in such a way that the test can be carried out on a simple 'go-no go' basis. The target shall preferably be one of the following types:


(a) an illuminated 'ring' target whose outer diameter, D, subtends an angle of N minutes of an arc at a point situated at x metres (Figure 11a); or


(b) an illuminated 'ring and spot' target whose dimensions are such that the distance, D from a point on the edge of the spot to the nearest point on the inside of the ring subtends and angle of n minutes of an arc at a point situated at x metres (Figure 11b);


where:


n is the limit value of secondary-image separation,


x is the distance from the safety-glass pane to the target (not less than 7 m),


D is given by the formula


D = x. tan n.


The illuminated target consists of a light box, approximately 300  300  150 mm, whose front is most inconveniently constructed of glass masked with opaque black paper or coated with matt black paint. The box shall be illuminated by a suitable light source. The inside of the box shall be coated with matt white paint.


It may be convenient to use other forms of target such as that shown in Figure 14. It is also acceptable to replace the target system by a projection system and to examine the resulting images on a screen.


9.3.1.1.2.


Procedure


Mount the safety glass pane at the specified rake angle on a suitable stand in such a way that the observation is carried out in the horizontal plane passing through the centre of the target.


The light box shall be viewed, in a dark or semi-dark room, through each part of the area being examined, in order to detect the presence of any secondary image associated with the illuminated target. Rotate the safety-glass pane as necessary to ensure that the correct direction of view is maintained. A monocular may be used for viewing.


9.3.1.1.3.


Expression of results


Determine whether,


- when the target is used (see Figure 11a), the primary and secondary images of the circle separate i.e. whether the limit value of n is exceeded, or,


- when target (b) is used (see Figure 11b), the secondary image of the spot shifts beyond the point of tangency with the inside edge of the circle, i.e. whether the limit value of n is exceeded.

9.3.1.2.


Collimation-telescope test


If necessary, the procedure described in this paragraph shall be applied.


9.3.1.2.1.


Apparatus


The apparatus comprises a collimator and a telescope and may be set up in accordance with Figure 19. However, any equivalent optical system may be used.


9.3.1.2.2.


Procedure


The collimation telescope forms, at infinity, the image of a polar coordinate system with a bright point at its centre (see Figure 14).


In the focal plane of the observation telescope a small opaque spot with a diameter slightly larger than that of the projected bright point is placed on the optical axis, thus obscuring the bright point.


When a test piece which exhibits a secondary image is placed between the telescope and the collimator a second, less bright, point appears at a certain distance from the centre of the polar coordinate system. The secondary image separation can be read out as the distance between the points seen through the observation telescope (see Figure 14).


(The distance between the dark spot and the bright spot at the centre of the polar coordinate system represents the optical deviation).


9.3.1.2.3.


Expression of results


The safety glass pane shall first be examined by a simple scanning technique to establish the area giving the strongest secondary image.


That area shall then be examined by the collimator-telescope system at the appropriate angle of incidence. The maximum secondary-image separation shall then be measured.


9.3.1.3.


The direction of observation in the horizontal plane shall be maintained approximately normal to the trace of the windscreen in that plane.


9.3.2.


The measurements shall be carried out in accordance with the vehicle categories in the zones as defined in item 9.2.2 above.


9.3.2.1.


Vehicle type


The test shall be repeated if the windscreen is to be mounted on a vehicle of a type which has a forward field of vision different from that of the type of vehicle for which the windscreen has already been component type approved.

FIRE-RESISTANCE TEST


10.1.


Purpose and scope


This method enables the horizontal burning rate of the materials used in the passenger compartment of motor vehicles (passenger cars, lorries, station wagons, motor buses) to be determined after exposure to a small flame.


This method permits testing of the materials and coverings used inside vehicles to be tested either individually or in combination up to a thickness of 13 mm. It is used to judge the uniformity of production batches of such materials in respect of their burning behaviour.


Because of the many differences between the real-world situation and the precise test conditions prescribed herein (application and orientation within a vehicle, conditions of use, ignition sources, etc.) this method cannot be considered to be suitable for evaluation of all true in-vehicle burning characteristics.


10.2.


Definitions


10.2.1.


Burning rate: the quotient of the burnt distance, measured in accordance with this method, and the time taken to burn at that distance.


It is expressed in millimetres per minute.


10.2.2.


Composite material: a material consisting of several layers of similar or different materials closely held together at their surface by cementing, bonding, cladding, welding, etc.


When different materials are connected together intermittently (for example by sewing, high frequency welding, riveting, etc.), thus permitting the taking of individual samples in accordance with item 10.5, such materials shall not be considered to be composite materials.


10.2.3.


Exposed side: the side which is facing towards the passenger compartment when the material is fitted to the vehicle.


10.3.


Principle


A sample is held horizontally in a U-shaped holder and is exposed to the action of a defined low-energy flame for 15 seconds in a combustion chamer, the flame acting on the free edge of the sample. The test determines whether and when the flame is extinguished, or the time the flame requires to travel over a measured distance.


10.4.


Apparatus


10.4.1.


Combustion chamber (Figure 15), preferably made of stainless steel, having the dimensions given in Figure 16.


The front of the chamber contains a flame-proof observation window, which may cover the entire front and which can act as an access panel.


The bottom of the chamber has vent holes and the top has a vent slot all around.


The combustion chamber is placed on four feet, 10 mm high. The chamber may have a hole at one end for the introduction of the sample holder containing the sample; in the opposite end a hole is provided for the gas-supply line. Melted material is caught in a pan (see Figure 17) which is placed on the bottom of the chamber between the vent holes without covering any of them.


10.4.2.


Sample holder consisting of two U-shaped metal plates or frames of corrosion-proof material. The dimensions are given in Figure 18.


The lower plate is equipped with pins and the upper one with corresponding holes in order to ensure a consistent holding of the sample. The pins also serve as measuring points at the beginning and end of the burning distance.


Intervals over the bottom U-shaped frame (see Figure 19).


The lower side of the sample shall be 178 mm above the floor plate; the distance of the front edge of the sample holder from end of the chamber shall be 22 mm; the distances of the longitudinal sides of the sample holder from the sides of the chamber shall be 50 mm (all inside dimensions) (see Figures 15 and 16).


10.4.3.


Gas burner


The small ignition source is provided by a Bunsen burner having an inside diameter of 9,5 mm. It is so located in the test cabinet that the centre of its nozzle is 19 mm below the centre of the bottom edge of the open end of the sample (see Figure 16).


10.4.4.


Test gas


The gas supplied to the burner shall have calorific value of about 38 MJ/m (for example natural gas).


10.4.5.


Metal comb, at least 110 mm in length, with seven or eight smooth rounded teeth per 25 mm.


10.4.6.


Stop-watch, accurate to 0,5 sec.


10.4.7.


Fume cupboard


The cumbustion chamber may be placed in a fume-cupboard assembly provided that the latter's internal volume is at least 20 times, but not more than 110 times, greater than the volume of the combustion chamber and provided that no single height, width, or length dimension of the fume cupboard is greater than 2/2 times either of the other two dimensions.


Before the test the vertical velocity of the air through the fume cupboard shall be measured 100 mm forward of and to the rear of the ultimate site of the combustion chamber. It shall be between 0,10 and 0,30 m/s in order to avoid possible discomfort to the operator from combustion products. It shall be possible to use a fume cupboard with natural ventilation and an appropriate air velocity.


10.5.


Samples


10.5.1.


Shape and dimension


The shape and dimensions of samples are given in Figure 20. The thickness of the sample corresponds to the thickness of the product to be tested. It shall not be more than 13 mm. When sample-taking so permits, the sample shall have a constant section over its entire length. When the shape and dimensions of a product do not permit a sample of a given size to be taken, the following minimum dimensions shall be maintained:


(a) for samples having a width of 3 to 60 mm, the length shall be 356 mm. In this case the material is tested over the product width;


(b) for a sample having a width of 60 to 100 mm the length shall be at least 138 mm. In this case the potential burning distance corresponds to the length of the sample, the measurement starting at the first measuring point;


(c) samples less than 60 mm wide and less than 356 mm long, and samples 60 to 100 mm wide and less than 138 mm long cannot be tested in accordance with the present method, nor can samples less than 3 mm wide.


10.5.2.


Sampling


At least five samples shall be taken from the material under test. In materials having burning rates differing according to the direction of the material (this being established by preliminary tests) the five (or more) samples shall be taken and placed in the test apparatus in such a way that the highest burning rate will be measured. When the material is supplied in set widths a length of at least 500 mm covering the entire width shall be cut. From the piece so cut the samples shall be taken at a point not less than 100 mm from the edge of the material and at points equidistant from each other.


Samples shall be taken in the same way from finished products when the shape of the product so permits. If the thickness of the product is over 13 mm it shall be reduced to 13 mm by a mechanical process applied to the side which does not face a passenger compartment.


Composite materials (see item 10.2.2) shall be tested as if they were homogeneous.


In the case of materials comprising superimposed layers of different composition which are not considered to be composite materials, all the layers of material included within a depth of 13 mm from the surface facing towards the passenger compartment shall be tested individually.


10.5.3.


Conditioning


The samples shall be coditioned for at least 24 hours, but not more than seven days, at a temperature of 23  2 oC and a relative humidity of 50  5 % and be maintained under these conditions until immediately prior to testing.


10.6.


Procedures


10.6.1.


Place samples with napped or tufted surfaces on a flat surface, and comb twice against the nap using the comb (item 10.4.5).


10.6.2.


Place the sample in the sample holder (item 10.4.2) so that the exposed side faces downwards towards the flame.


10.6.3.


Adjust the gas flame to a height of 38 mm using the mark on the chamber, the air intake of the burner being closed. The flame shall burn for at least one minute, for stabilization, before the first test is started.


10.6.4.


Push the sample-holder into the combustion chamber so that the end of the sample is exposed to the flame, and after 15 seconds cut off the gas flow.


10.6.5.


Measurement of the burning time starts at the moment when the foot of the flame passes the first measuring point. Observe the flame propagation on the side (upper or lower) which burns faster.


10.6.6.


Measurement of the burning time is completed when the flame has come to the last measuring point or when the flame is extinguished before reaching that point. If the flame does not reach the last measuring point, measure the burnt distance up to the point where the flame is extinguished. The burnt distance is that part of the sample destroyed, on the surface or inside, by burning.


10.6.7.


If the sample does not ignite or does not continue burning after the burner has been extinguished, or the flame goes out before reaching the first measuring point, so that no burning time can be measured, note in the test report that the burning speed is 0 mm/min.


10.6.8.


When running a series of tests or performing repeat tests make sure before starting a test that the temperature of the combustion chamber and sample holder does not exceed 30 oC.


10.7.


Calculation


The burning rate B, in mm per minute, is given by the formula:


B =


s


t


 60


where:


s is the burnt distance, in millimetres,


t is the time, in seconds, taken to burn the distance s.


10.8.


Indices of difficulty of the secondary characteristics


No secondary characteristics are involved.


10.9.


Interpretation of results


Plastic coated (item 2.3 in Annex I) and plastic safety glazing (item 2.4 in Annex I) should be considered satisfactory from the point of view of burning behaviour (fire resistance) if the burn rate does not exceed 250 mm minute.

1.2.


the height of segment;


1.3.


the curvature.


2.


A GROUP IS MADE UP OF A THICKNESS CLASS


3.


CLASSIFICATION IS PERFORMED IN ASCENDING ORDER OF DEVELOPED AREAS


The five largest and the five smallest developed areas shall be selected, and shall be numbered as follows:


1 for the largest 1 for the smallest


2 for the next smallest after 1 2 for the next largest after 1


3 for the next smallest after 2 3 for the next largest after 2


4 for the next smallest after 3 4 for the next largest after 3


5 for the next smallest after 4 5 for the next largest after 4


4.


WITHIN EACH OF THE TWO SERIES DEFINED IN ITEM 3 THE HEIGHTS OF SEGMENT SHALL BE INDICATED AS FOLLOWS:


1 for the largest height of segment,


2 for the next smallest,


3 for the next smallest after the preceding value, etc.


5.


IN EACH OF THE TWO SERIES DEFINED IN ITEM 3 THE RADII OF CURVATURE SHALL BE INDICATED AS FOLLOWS:


1 for the smallest radius of curvature,


2 for the next largest radius of curvature,


3 for the radius of curvature next largest to the preceding radius, etc.


6.


THE NUMBERS AWARDED TO EACH WINDSCREEN IN THE TWO SERIES DEFINED IN ITEM 3 ABOVE SHALL BE ADDED TOGETHER


6.1.


That windscreen among the five largest which has the smallest total and that windscreen among the five smallest which has the smallest total shall be selected for the full tests defined in Annex II B, II C, II D or II K.

A few windscreens having significantly different parameters of shape and/or radius of curvature from the extremes of the selected group may also be tested if the technical department conducting the tests considers that the parameters in question are likely to have appreciable adverse effects.


8.


The limits of the group are determined by the developed area of the windscreens. Where a windscreen submitted for component type-approval for a given type has a developed area outside the approved limit and/or has a significantly greater height of segment or a significantly smaller radius of curvature, it shall be considered to be a new type and be subjected to additional tests if the technical department deems such tests technically necessary, having regard to the information already in its possession concerning the product and the material used.


9.


Should any other windscreen model subsequently be manufactured by the holder of a component type-approval in a thickness class already component type approved:


9.1.


it shall be ascertained whether that model can be included among the five largest or the five smallest selected for the component type approval of the group in question;


9.2.


renumbering shall be by the procedures defined in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5.


9.3.


if the sum of the numbers awarded to the windscreen newly incorporated among the five largest or five smallest windscreens:

Council Directive No 92/53/EEC of 18 June 1992 amending Directive 70/156/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers




COUNCIL DIRECTIVE No 92/53/EEC of 18 June 1992 amending Directive 70/156/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas it is important to adopt measures with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992; whereas the internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured;


Whereas Directive 70/156/EEC (4) laid down the Community type-approval procedure for vehicles, components and separate technical units built in compliance with the technical requirements set out in separate Directives and also the complete list of vehicle systems, components and separate technical units covered by these Directives;


Whereas in the interest of the establishment and operation of the internal market of the Community it appears appropriate to replace the existing type-approval systems of the Member States by the Community type-approval procedure;


Whereas, in order that the said type-approval procedure may achieve its objective in the most effective manner it appears necessary to make its administrative provisions more precise and comprehensive; whereas this implies, inter alia, that these provisions allow for the type-approval of a whole vehicle to be established by compilation of approvals of its constituent systems, components and separate technical units, if the manufacturer so desires, and in the case of vehicles built in several stages involving several manufacturers, by compilation of the approvals of the different stages of completion;


Whereas a vehicle may comply with the provisions of this Directive but nevertheless have certain features which demonstrably present a potential risk for road safety; whereas it is therefore desirable to allow the Member States to refuse to approve such vehicle types as well as to prohibit the sale and entry into service and refuse registration of the said vehicles; whereas for the latter case appropriate conditions are established;


Whereas the mandatory nature of the Community type-approval procedure makes it necessary to allow for exemptions and lay down alternative procedures for vehicles either designed for special purposes or built in small series or incorporating new technologies not yet covered by the provisions of the separate Directives;


Whereas in order to facilitate the access to the markets of countries outside the Community it appears appropriate to allow, under certain conditions, for the acceptance of system, component and separate technical unit approvals based on equivalent international and third-country regulations; whereas equivalence of such regulations is to be established in application of the relevant provisions of the Treaty;


Whereas in order to ensure the necessary transparancy of the Community type-approval procedures it is necessary to lay down provisions according to which the Member States shall notify each other and the Commission of their approval authorities and technical services as well as provisions on the quality criteria with which the latter have to comply;


Whereas since the Annexes to the present Directive are complete only for vehicles of category M1, the Directive applies only to the type-approval of such vehicles; whereas it appears advisable that pending the completion of the Annexes by provisions relating to vehicles of all other categories, Member States should be allowed to continue to operate their national approval systems in relation to such vehicles in accordance with Article 10 of Directive 70/156/EEC;


Whereas, in order to allow for an adequate transition, both from the technical and administrative points of view, from the present optional regime of Community requirements to the mandatory type-approval procedure established by the present Directive, it appears appropriate to leave the manufacturers the option between the application of the procedure of the present Directive and that provided for in Article 10 of Directive 70/156/EEC for a period of three years; whereas approvals granted in application of the latter procedure should remain valid until 31 December 1997;


Whereas the aforementioned transitional provisions are not intended to allow the Member States to derogate from the provisions of separate Directives which are based on total harmonization,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


Article 1


Directive 70/156/EEC is hereby amended as follows:


1. Articles 1 to 16 are replaced by the following Articles:


'Article 1


Scope


This Directive applies to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers built in one or more stages, of systems, components and separate technical units intended for use on such vehicles and trailers.

Article 4


The type-approval process


1. Each Member State shall grant:


(a) vehicle type-approval to:


- vehicle types which conform to the particulars in the information folder and which meet the technical requirements of all the relevant separate Directives as prescribed in Annex IV,


- special-purpose vehicle types mentioned in Annex XI which conform to the particulars in the information folder and which meet the technical requirements of the separate Directives as denoted in the relevant column of Annex XI.


This process shall be satisfied by the procedures described in Annex V;


(b) multi-stage type-approval to base, incomplete or completed vehicle types which conform to the particulars in the information folder and which meet the technical requirements of the relevant separate Directives as prescribed in Annex IV or XI taking account of the state of completion of the vehicle type.


This process shall be satisfied by the procedures described in Annex XIV;


(c) system type-approval to vehicle types which conform to the particulars in the information folder and which meet the technical requirements of a relevant separate Directive;


(d) component or separate technical unit type-approval to all types of component or separate technical unit which conform to the particulars in the information folder and which meet the technical requirements contained in the relevant separate Directive which makes express provision for so doing.


2. However, if a Member State finds that a vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit which complies with the provisions of paragraph 1 is nevertheless, a serious risk to road safety, it may refuse to grant the type-approval. It shall forthwith inform the other Member States and the Commission thereof, stating the reasons on which its decision is based.


3. Each Member State shall complete all applicable sections of a type-approval certificate (models for which are given in Annex VI to this Directive and in an Annex to each of the separate Directives) for each type of vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit which it approves and, in addition, shall complete the relevant sections of the test results attachment to the vehicle approval certificate (the model for which is given in Annex VIII) and shall compile or verify the contents of the index to the information package. Approval certificates shall be numbered in accordance with the method described in Annex VII. The completed certificate and its attachments shall be delivered to the applicant.


4. Where the component or the separate technical unit to be approved fulfils its function or offers a specific feature only in conjunction with other parts of the vehicle and for this reason compliance with one or more requirements can be verified only when the component or separate technical unit to be approved operates in conjunction with other vehicle parts, whether real or simulated, the scope of the type-approval of the component or the separate technical unit must be restricted accordingly. The type-approval certificate for a component or a separate technical unit shall then include any restrictions on its use and shall indicate any conditions for fitting it. Observance of these restrictions and conditions shall be verified at the time of type-approval of the vehicle.


5. The approval authority of each Member State shall, within one month, send to the approval authorities of the other Member States a copy of the vehicle type-approval certificate (together with its attachments) for each vehicle type which it has approved or refused to approve or withdrawn.


6. The approval authority of each Member State shall send monthly to the approval authorities of the Member States a list (containing the particulars shown in Annex XIII) of the system, component or separate technical unit approvals it has granted, refused to grant or withdrawn during that month; in addition, on receiving an application from the approval authority of another Member State, it shall send forthwith a copy of the system, component or separate technical unit type-approval certificate and/or information package for each type of system, component or separate technical unit which it has approved or refused to approve or withdrawn.


Article 5

2. The application for the amendment or extension of a type-approval shall be submitted exclusively to the Member State which granted the original type-approval.


3. In the case of system, component or separate technical unit approval, if particulars appearing in the information package have changed, the approval authority of the Member State in question shall:


- issue revised page(s) of the information package as necessary, marking each revised page to show clearly the nature of the change and the date of re-issue. On any occasion when revised pages are issued the index to the information package (which is attached to the approval certificate) shall also be amended to show the latest dates of revised pages, and


- issue a revised approval certificate (denoted by an extension number) if any information on it (excluding its attachments) has changed or if the requirements of the Directive have changed since the date currently on the approval. The revised certificate shall show clearly the reason for revision and the date of re-issue.


If the approval authorities of the Member State in question find that an amendment to an information package warrants fresh tests or checks it shall inform the manufacturer thereof and issue the documents mentioned above only after the conduct of successful fresh tests or checks.


4. In the case of vehicle approval, if particulars appearing in the information package have changed, the approval authority of the Member State in question shall:


- issue revised page(s) of the information package as necessary, marking each revised page to show clearly the nature of the change and the date of re-issue. On any occasion when revised pages are issued the index to the information package (which is attached to the approval certificate) shall also be amended to show the latest dates of revised pages, and


- issue a revised approval certificate (denoted by an extension number) if either further inspections are required or any information on the approval certificate (excluding its attachments) has changed or if the requirements of any of the separate Directives applicable to the date from which first entry into service is prohibited have changed since the date currently on the vehicle approval. The new certificate shall show clearly the reason for extension and the date of re-issue.


If the approval authority of the Member State in question finds that an amendment to an information package warrants fresh inspections it shall inform the manufacturer thereof and issue the documents mentioned above only after the conduct af successful fresh inspections. Any revised documents shall be sent to all other approval authorities within one month.


5. Where a vehicle type-approval is no longer valid because one or more of the separate Directive approvals referred to in its information package is no longer valid the approval authority of the Member State which granted that approval shall, within one month, communicate that fact to the approval authorities of the other Member States together with an indication of the relevant date or the vehicle identification number of the last vehicle produced in conformity with the old certificate.


Article 6


Certificate of conformity


1. The manufacturer, in his capacity as the holder of a vehicle type-approval, shall issue a certificate of conformity (models for which are given in Annex IX), which shall accompany each vehicle, whether complete or incomplete, manufactured in conformity with the approved vehicle type. In the case of an incomplete or completed vehicle type, the manufacturer shall complete only those items on side 2 of the certificate of conformity which have been added or changed at the current stage of approval and, if applicable, shall attach to this certificate all certificates of conformity delivered at the previous stage(s).


2. However, Member States may, for purposes of vehicle taxation or registration, after giving at least three months' notice to the Commission and the other Member States, request particulars not mentioned in Annex IX to be added to the certificate provided that such particulars are explicitly stated in the information package or can be derived from it by a simple calculation.


Member States may also request that the certificate of conformity contained in Annex IX be completed in such a way as to highlight the data necessary and sufficient for the purposes of taxation and registration by the national competent authorities.


3. The manufacturer, in his capacity as the holder of a type-approval for a component or separate technical unit shall affix to each component or unit manufactured in conformity with the approved type the trade name or mark, the type and/or, if the separate Directive so provides, the type-approval mark or number. However, in the latter case, the manufacturer may choose not to affix the trade name or mark and type.


4. The manufacturer, in his capacity as the holder of a type-approval certificate, which in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 (4) includes restrictions on its use, shall deliver with each component or unit manufactured detailed information on these restrictions and shall indicate any conditions for fitting it.


Article 7


Registration and entry into service


1. Each Member State shall register, permit the sale or entry into service of new vehicles on grounds relating to their construction and functioning if, and only if, they are accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity. In the case of incomplete vehicles, each Member State shall permit the sale of such vehicles but may refuse their permanent registration and entry into service so long as they are not completed.


2. Each Member State shall permit the sale or entry into service of components or separate technical units if, and only if, they comply with the requirement of the relevant separate Directive and the requirements referred to in Article 6 (3) provided that this shall not apply to components and separate technical units intended for use on vehicles which are fully or partially exempt from or not covered by this Directive.


3. If a Member State finds that vehicles, components or separate technical units of a particular type are a serious risk to road safety although they are accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity or are properly marked, then that State may, for a maximum period of six months, refuse to register such vehicles or may prohibit the sale or entry into service in its territory of such vehicles, components or separate technical units. It shall forthwith notify the other Member States and the Commission thereof, stating the reasons on which its decision is based. If the Member State which granted type-approval disputes the risk to road safety notified to it the Member States concerned shall endeavour to settle the dispute. The Commission shall be kept informed and shall, where necessary, hold appropriate consultations for the purpose of reaching a settlement.


Article 8


Exemptions and alternative procedures


1. The requirements of Article 7 (1) do not apply to:


- vehicles intended for use by the armed services, civil defence, fire services and forces responsible for maintaining public order,


- vehicles approved in accordance with paragraph 2.


2. Each Member State may, at the request of the manufacturer, exempt from one or more of the provisions of one or more of the separate Directives:


(a) Vehicles produced in small series


In this case, the number of vehicles of a family of types per year registered, sold or entering service in that Member State shall be limited to not more than the number of units shown in Annex XII. Each year the Member States shall send to the Commission a list of such approvals. The Member State granting such an approval shall send a copy of the approval certificate and its attachments to the approval authorities of the other Member States designated by the manufacturer, stating the nature of exemptions which have been granted. Within three months these Member States shall decide whether, and for which number of units, they accept the type-approval for vehicles to be registered within their territory. For the purposes of approvals granted in accordance with this point (a), the requirements of Articles 3, 4, 5, 6, 10 and 11 shall apply only in so far as they are deemed to be relevant by the approval authority. Where an exemption is granted in accordance with this point (a) the Member State may require a relevant alternative provision;


(b) End-of-series vehicles


1. Within the quantitative limits contained in Annex XII, section B and for a limited period Member States may register and permit the sale or entry into service of new vehicles conforming to a type of vehicle whose type-approval is no longer valid under Article 5 (5).


This provision shall apply only to vehicles which:


- were in the territory of the European Community, and


- were accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity which had been issued


when the type-approval of the vehicle in question was still valid, but which had not been registered or put into service before the said type-approval lost its validity.


This option shall be limited to a period of 12 months for complete vehicles and 18 months for vehicles completed as from the date on which the type-approval lost its validity.


2. For paragraph 1 to be applied to one or more vehicle types of a given category, the manufacturer must submit a request to the competent authorities of the Member State which approved the corresponding type(s) of vehicle before the entry into force of the separate Directives or of the amendments thereto.


The request must specify the technical and/or economic reasons on which it is based.


If the request is accepted by the Member State, the latter must, within a month, send the competent authorities of the other Member States particulars of and reasons for the exemptions granted to the manufacturer together with the information provided for in Article 5 (5).


Each Member State concerned by the entry into service of such types of vehicle shall be responsible for ensuring that the manufacturer complies with the provisions of Annex XII B.


Member States shall each year send the Commission a list of exemptions granted and the reasons therefor.


(c) Vehicles, components or separate technical units incorporating technologies or concepts which cannot, due to their specific nature, comply with one or more of the requirements of one or more of the separate Directives


In this case, the Member State granting such an approval shall, within one month, send a copy of the approval certificate and its attachments to the approval authorities of the other Member States and shall forthwith send to the Commission a report containing:


- the reason why the technologies or concepts in question prevent the vehicle, component or separate technical unit from complying with the requirements of one or more of the relevant separate Directives,


- a description of the areas of safety and environmental protection concerned and the measures taken,


- a description of the tests and their results that demonstrate at least an equivalent level of safety and environmental protection as is provided by the requirements of one or more of the relevant separate Directives.


- proposals for amendments to the relevant separate Directives or new separate Directive(s) as applicable.


The Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 13, decide within three months whether or not to approve the report.


If the Commission approves the report, the Member State may issue a type-approval in accordance with this Directive and the Commission will take the necessary steps to adapt the separate Directive(s) to which the derogation was granted. The validity of such type-approval is restricted to 24 months, but may be extended by the Commission upon request of the Member State which has granted the type-approval.


3. Approval certificates issued in accordance with paragraph 2, the models for which are shown in Annex VI, may not carry the heading 'EEC Vehicle Type-Approval Certificate', except in the case mentioned in 2 (c) where the Commission has approved the report.


Article 9


Acceptance of equivalent approvals


1. The Council may, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, acknowledge the equivalence between the conditions or provisions for type-approval of systems, components and separate technical units established by the present Directive and the procedures established by international regulations or regulations of third countries, in the framework of multilateral or bilateral agreements between the Community and third countries.


2. The equivalence of the international regulations listed in Part II of Annex IV with the corresponding separate Directives shall be recognized. The approval authorities of the Member States shall accept approvals according to those regulations and, where applicable, the pertaining approval marks, in lieu of the corresponding approvals and/or approvals marks according to the equivalent separate Directives. The listed international regulations shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.


Article 10


Conformity of production arrangements


1. A Member State granting type-approval shall take the necessary measures in accordance with Annex X in relation to that approval to verify, if need be in cooperation with the approval authorities of the other Member States, that adequate arrangements have been made to ensure that production vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units, as the case may be, conform to the approved type.


2. A Member State which has granted a type approval shall take the necessary measures in accordance with Annex X in relation to that approval to verify, if need be in cooperation with the approval authorities of the other Member States, that the arrangements referred to in paragraph 1 continue to be adequate and that production vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units, as the case may be, continue to conform to the approved type. Verification to ensure that products conform to the approved type shall be limited to the procedures set out in section 2 of Annex X and in those separate Directives that contain specific requirements.


Article 11


Nonconformity with the approved type


1. There shall be failure to conform to the approved type where deviations from the particulars in the type-approval certificate and/or the information package are found to exist und where these deviations have not been authorized under Article 5 (3) or (4), by the Member State which granted the type-approval. A vehicle shall not be considered to deviate from the approved type where tolerances are permitted by separate Directives and these tolerances are respected.


2. If a Member State which has granted type-approval finds that vehicles, components or separate technical units accompanied by a certificate of conformity or bearing an approval mark do not conform to the type it has approved, it shall take the necessary measures to ensure that production vehicles, components or separate technical units, as the case may be, again conform to the approved type. The approval authorities of that Member State shall advise those of the other Member States of the measures taken which may, where necessary, extend to withdrawal of type-approval.


3. If a Member State demonstrates that vehicles, components or separate technical units accompanied by a certificate of conformity or bearing an approval mark do not conform to the approved type it may request the Member State which granted the type-approval to verify that vehicles, components or separate technical units, as the case may be, in production conform to the approved type. Such action shall be taken as soon as possible and in any case within six months of the date of the request.


4. In the case of:


- vehicle type-approval where the nonconformity of a vehicle arises exclusively from the nonconformity of a system, component or separate technical unit, or


- multi-stage type-approval where the nonconformity of a completed vehicle arises exclusively from the nonconformity of a system, component or separate technical unit being part of the incomplete vehicle, or of the incomplete vehicle itself,


the vehicle-approval authority shall request the Member State(s) which granted any relevant system, component, separate technical unit or incomplete vehicle type-approval(s) to take the necessary action to ensure that vehicles in production again conform to the approved type. Such action shall be taken as soon as possible and in any case within six months of the date of the request, if necessary in conjunction with the Member State making the request. Where a failure to conform is established, the approval authorities of the Member State which granted the system, component or separate technical unit type-approval or the approval of the incomplete vehicle shall take the measures set out in paragraph 2.


5. The approval authorities of the Member States shall inform each other within one month of any withdrawal of type-approval and of the reasons for such a measure.


6. If the Member State which granted type-approval disputes the failure to conform notified to it the Member States concerned shall endeavour to settle the dispute. The Commission shall be kept informed and shall, where necessary, hold appropriate consultations for the purpose of reaching a settlement.


Article 12


Notification of decisions and remedies available


All decisions taken pursuant to the provisions adopted in implementation of this Directive and refusing or withdrawing type-approval, or refusing registration or prohibiting sale, shall state in detail the reasons on which they are based. Any decisions shall be notified to the party concerned who shall, at the same time, be informed of the remedies available to him under the laws in force in the Member States and of the time limits allowed for the exercise of such remedies.


Article 13


Adaptation of the Annexes


1. A Committee for Adaptation to Technical Progress hereinafter called 'the Committee', is hereby set up; it shall consist of representatives of the Member States with a representative of the Commission as Chairman.


2. All the amendments necessary for adapting:

- the provisions of the separate Directives, save as otherwise provided therein,


shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 3. This procedure shall also apply to the introduction of provisions on the type-approval of separate technical units into the separate Directives.


3. The representative of the Commission shall submit to the Committee a draft of the measures to be taken. The Committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within a time limit which the Chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter. The opinion shall be delivered by the majority laid down in Article 148 (2) of the Treaty in the case of decisions which the Council is required to adopt on a proposal from the Commission. The votes of the representatives of the Member States within the Regulation shall be weighted in the manner set out in that Article. The Chairman shall not vote.


The Commission shall adopt the measures envisaged if they are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee.


If the measures envisaged are not in accordance with the opinion of the Committee or if no opinion is delivered, the Commission shall, without delay, submit to the Council a proposal relating to the measures to be taken. The Council shall act by a qualified majority.


If, within three months of the proposal being submitted to it, the Council has not acted, the proposed measures shall be adopted by the Commission.


4. Should the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, adopt a new separate Directive, it shall on the basis of that same proposal adopt appropriate amendments to the relevant Annexes to this Directive.


Article 14


Notification of approval authorities and technical services


1. The Member States shall notify to the Commission and to the other Member States the names and addresses of:

ANNEX II


DEFINITION OF VEHICLE CATEGORIES AND VEHICLE TYPES A. Vehicle categories are defined according to the following international classification:


1. Category M:


Motor vehicles with at least four wheels used for the carriage of passengers.


Category M1:


Vehicles used for the carriage of passengers and comprising no more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat.


Category M2:


Vehicles used for the carriage of passengers, comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat, and having a maximum mass not exceeding 5 tonnes.


Category M3:


Vehicles used for the carriage of passengers, comprising more than eight seats in addition to the driver's seat, and having a maximum mass exceeding 5 tonnes.

Category N2:


Vehicles used for the carriage of goods and having a maximum mass exceeding 3,5 tonnes but not exceeding 12 tonnes.


Category N3:


Vehicles used for the carriage of goods and having a maximum mass exceeding 12 tonnes.


In the case of a towing vehicle designed to be coupled to a semi-trailer or centre-axle trailer, the mass to be considered for classifying the vehicle is the mass of the tractor vehicle in running order, increased by the mass corresponding to the maximum static vertical load transferred to the tractor vehicle by the semi-trailer or centre-axle trailer and, where applicable, by the maximum mass of the tractor vehicles's own load.


3. Category O:


Trailers (including semi-trailers).


Category O1:


Trailers with a maximum mass not exceeding 0,75 tonnes.


Category O2:


Trailers with a maximum mass exceeding 0,75 tonnes but not exceeding 3,5 tonnes.


Category O3:


Trailers with a maximum mass exceeding 3,5 tonnes but not exceeding 10 tonnes.


Category O4:


Trailers with a maximum mass exceeding 10 tonnes.


In the case of a semi-trailer or centre-axle trailer, the maximum mass to be considered for classifying the trailer corresponds to the static vertical load transmitted to the ground by the axle or axles of the semi-trailer or centre-axle trailer when coupled to the towing vehicle and carrying its maximum load.


4. Vehicles in categories M and N, above, considered to be off-road vehicles under the load and checking conditions set out in item 4.4 and pursuant to the definitions and sketches of item 4.5.


4.1. Vehicles in category N1 with a maximum mass not exceeding two tonnes and motor vehicles in category M1 are considered to be off-road vehicles if they have:


- at least one front axle and at least one rear axle designed to be driven simultaneously including vehicles where the drive to one axle can be disengaged,


- at least one differential locking mechanism or at least one mechanism having a similar effect and if they can climb a 30 % gradient calculated for a solo vehicle.


In addition, they must satisfy at least five of the following six requirements:


- the approach angle must be at least 25 degrees,


- the departure angle must be at least 20 degrees,


- the ramp angle must be at least 20 degrees,


- the ground clearance under the front axle must be at least 180 mm,


- the ground clearance under the rear axle must be at least 180 mm,


- the ground clearance between the axles must be at least 200 mm.


4.2. Vehicles in category N1 with a maximum mass exceeding two tonnes or in category N2, M2 or M3 with a maximum mass not exceeding 12 tonnes are considered to be off-road vehicles either if all their wheels are designed to be driven simultaneously, including vehicles where the drive to one axle can be disengaged, or if the following three requirements are satisfied:


- at least one front axle and at least one rear axle are designed to be driven simultaneously, including vehicles where the drive to one axle can be disengaged,


- there is at least one differential locking mechanism or at least one mechanism having a similar effect,


- they can climb a 25 % gradient calculated for a solo vehicle.


4.3. Vehicles in category M3 with a maximum mass exceeding 12 tonnes or in category N3 are to be considered to be off-road vehicles either if the wheels are designed to be driven simultaneously, including vehicles where the drive to one axle can be disengaged, or if the following requirements are satisfied:


- at least half the wheels are driven,


- there is at least one differential locking mechanism or at least one mechanism having a similar effect,


- they can climb a 25 % gradient calculated for a solo vehicle,


- at least four of the following six requirements are satisfied:


- the approach angle must be at least 25 degrees,


- the departure angle must be at least 25 degrees,


- the ramp angle must be at least 25 degrees,


- the ground clearance under the front axle must be at least 250 mm,


- the ground clearance between the axles must be at least 300 mm,


- the ground clearance under the rear axle must be least 250 mm.


4.4. Load and checking conditions.


4.4.1. Vehicles in category N1 with a maximum mass not exceeding two tonnes and vehicles in category M1 must be in running order, namely with coolant fluid, lubricants, fuel, tools, spare-wheel and a driver considered to weigh a standard 75 kilograms.


4.4.2. Motor vehicles other than those referred to in 4.4.1 must be loaded to the technically permissible maximum mass stated by the manufacturer.


4.4.3. The ability to climb the required gradients (25 % and 30 %) is verified by simple calculation. In exceptional cases, however, the technical services may ask for a vehicle of the type concerned to be submitted to it for an actual test.


4.4.4. When measuring approach and departure angles and ramp angles, no account is taken of underrun protective devices.


4.5. Definitions and sketches of approach and departure angles, ramp angle and ground clearance.


4.5.1. 'Approach angle' means the maximum angle between the ground plane and planes tangential to the tyres of the front wheels, under a static load, such that no point of the vehicle ahead of the front axle is situated below these planes and no rigid part of the vehicle, with the exception of any steps, is situated below these planes.


4.5.2. 'Departure angle' means the maximum angle between the ground plane and planes tangential to the tyres of the rear wheels, under a static load, such that no point of the vehicle behind the rearmost axle is situated below these planes and no rigid part of the vehicle is situated below these planes.


4.5.3. 'Ramp angle' means the minimum acute angle between two planes, perpendicular to the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle, tangential to the tyres of the front wheels and to the tyres of the rear wheels respectively, under a static load, the intersection of which touches the rigid underside of the vehicle apart from the wheels. This angle defines the steepest ramp over which the vehicle can pass.


4.5.4. 'Ground clearance between the axles' means the shortest distance between the ground plane and the lowest fixed point of the vehicle.


Multi-axled bogies are considered to be a single axle.


4.5.5. 'Ground clearance beneath one axle' means the distance beneath the highest point of the arc of a circle passing through the centre of the tyre footprint of the wheels on one axle (the inner wheels in the case of twin tyres) and touching the lowest fixed point of the vehicle between the wheels.


No rigid part of the vehicle may project into the shaded area of the diagram. Where appropriate, the ground clearance of several axles is indicated in accordance with their arrangement, for example 280/250/250.

ANNEX X


CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION PROCEDURES 1. INITIAL ASSESSMENT


1.1. The approval authority of a Member State must verify, before granting type-approval, the existence of satisfactory arrangements and procedures for ensuring effective control so that components, systems, separate technical units or vehicles when in production conform to the approved type.


1.2. The requirement in point 1.1 must be verified to the satisfaction of the authority granting type-approval but may also be verified, on behalf of the authority granting type-approval, by the approval authority of another Member State. In that case, the latter approval authority prepares a statement of compliance outlining the areas and production facilities it has covered as relevant to the product(s) to be type approved.


1.3. The approval authority must also accept the manufacturer's registration to harmonized standard EN 29002 (whose scope covers the product(s) to be approved) or an equivalent accreditation standard as satisfying the requirements of point 1.1. The manufacturer must provide details of the registration and undertake to inform the approval authority of any revisions to its validity or scope.


1.4. On receiving an application from the authority of another Member State, the approval authority sends forthwith the statement of compliance mentioned in the last sentence of point 1.2 or advises that it is not in a position to provide such a statement.


2. CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION


2.1. Every vehicle, system, component or separate technical unit(s) approved pursuant to this Directive or a separate Directive must be so manufactured as to conform to the type approved by meeting the requirements of this Directive or a separate Directive contained in the complete list set out in Annex IV or Annex XI.


2.2. The approval authority of a Member State, granting a type-approval must verify the existence of adequate arrangements and documented control plans, to be agreed with the manufacturer for each approval, to carry out at specified intervals those tests or associated checks necessary to verify continued conformity with the approved type including specifically, where applicable, tests specified in the separate Directives.


2.3. The holder of the approval must, in particular:


2.3.1. ensure the existence of procedures for effective control of the conformity of products (vehicles, systems, components or separate technical units) to the type-approval;


2.3.2. have access to the testing equipment necessary for checking the conformity to each approved type;


2.3.3. ensure that test results data are recorded and that annexed documents remain available for a period to be determined in agreement with the approval authority. This period must not exceed 10 years;


2.3.4. analyse the results of each type of test, in order to verify and ensure the stability of the product characteristics, making allowance for variation of an industrial production;


2.3.5. ensure that for each type of product, at least the checks prescribed in this Directive and the tests prescribed in the applicable separate Directives contained in the complete list set out in Annex IV or Annex XI, are carried out;


2.3.6. ensure that any set of samples or test pieces, giving evidence of nonconformity in the type of test in question gives rise to a further sampling and test. All the necessary steps shall be taken to restore conformity of the corresponding production;


2.3.7. in the case of vehicle approval, the checks referred to in point 2.3.5 are restricted to those verifying the correct build specification in relation to the approval certification.


2.4. The authority which has granted type-approval may at any time verify the conformity control methods applied in each production facility. The normal frequency of these verifications must be consistent with the arrangements (if any) accepted under point 1.2 or 1.3 of this Annex and be such as to ensure that the relevant controls are reviewed over a period consistent with the climate of trust established by the approval authority.


2.4.1. At every inspection, the test records and production records shall be made available to the visiting inspector.


2.4.2. Where the nature of the test is appropriate, the inspector may select samples at random to be tested in the manufacturer's laboratory (or by the technical service where the separate Directive so provides). The minimum number of samples may be determined according to the results of the manufacturer's own verification.


2.4.3. Where the level of control appears unsatisfactory, or when it seems necessary to verify the validity of the tests carried out in application of point 2.4.2, the inspector must select samples to be sent to the technical service which conducted the type-approval tests.


2.4.4. The approval authority may carry out any check or test prescribed in this Directive or in the applicable separate Directives contained in the complete list set out in Annex IV or Annex XI.


2.4.5. In cases where unsatisfactory results are found during an inspection, the approval authority must ensure that all necessary steps are taken to restore conformity of production as rapidly as possible.

ANNEX XIV


PROCEDURES TO BE FOLLOWED DURING MULTI-STAGE TYPE-APPROVAL (see Article 4) 1. GENERAL


1.1. The satisfactory operation of the process of multi-stage type-approval requires joint action by all the manufacturers concerned. To this end approval authorities must ensure, before granting second or subsequent stage approval, that suitable arrangements exist between the relevant manufacturers for the supply and interchange of documents and information such that the completed vehicle type meets the technical requirements of all the relevant separate Directives as prescribed in Annex IV or Annex XI. Such information must include details of relevant system, component and separate technical unit approvals and of vehicle parts which form part of the incomplete vehicle but are not yet approved.


1.2. Type-approvals in accordance with this Annex are granted on the basis of the current state of completion of the vehicle type and must incorporate all approvals granted at earlier stages.


1.3. Each manufacturer in a multi-stage approval process is responsible for the approval and conformity of production of all systems, components or separate technical units manufactured by him or added by him to the previously built stage. He is not responsible for subjects which have been approved in an earlier stage except in those cases where he modifies relevant parts to an extent that the previously granted approval becomes invalid.


2. PROCEDURES


In the case of an application made in accordance with Article 3 (3), the approval authority must:


(a) verify that all relevant separate Directive approvals are applicable to the appropriate standard in the separate Directive;


(b) ensure that all the relevant data, taking account of the state of completion of the vehicle, is included in the information folder;


(c) by reference to the documentation make sure that the vehicle specification(s) and data contained in Part I of the vehicle information folder are included in the data in the information packages and/or the approval certificates of the relevant separate Directive approvals; and in the case of a completed vehicle, where an item number in Part I of the information folder is not included in the information package of any of the separate Directives, confirm that the relevant part of characteristic conforms to the particulars in the information folder;


(d) on a selected sample of vehicles from the type to be approved carry out or arrange to be carried out inspections of vehicle parts and systems to verify that the vehicle(s) is/are built in accordance with the relevant data contained in the authenticated information package in respect of all relevant separate Directive approvals;


(e) carry out or arrange to be carried out relevant installation checks in respect of separate technical units where applicable.


3. The number of vehicles to be inspected for the purposes of paragraph 2 (d) must be sufficient to permit the proper control of the various combinations to be approved according to the state of completion of the vehicle and the following criteria:

THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2262/84 of 17 July 1984 laying down special measures in respect of olive oil (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 593/92 (2), and in particular Article 5 thereof,


Whereas, under Article 1 (3) of Regulation (EEC) No 2262/84, the Commission may take part in the discussions held by the agency's management; whereas the arrangements for such participation in the discussions of the four agencies should therefore be laid down;


Whereas, under Article 1 (4) of Regulation (EEC) No 2262/84, Member States shall act upon the agency's findings and shall regularly communicate to the Commission details of the action taken and the sanctions applied as a result of the agency's findings; whereas the intervals at which such communications are to be made and their content are to be laid down;


Whereas experience has shown that the period provided for in Article 6 (2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 27/85 (3), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2427/86 (4), within which the Commission is to take a decision with regard to the amount representing the agency's actual expenditure, is too short; whereas that period should therefore be extended;

Council Directive 92/14/EEC of 2 March 1992 on the limitation of the operation of aeroplanes covered by Part II, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, second edition (1988)




COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/14/EEC of 2 March 1992 on the limitation of the operation of aeroplanes covered by Part II, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, second edition (1988)


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 84 (2) thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1) ,


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2) ,


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3) ,


Whereas the application of noise emission standards to civil subsonic jet aeroplanes has significant consequences for the provision of air transport services, in particular where such standards limit the useful life of aeroplanes operated by airlines; whereas Council Directive 80/51/EEC(4) , fixes limits on emission of such noise;


Whereas Council Directive 89/629/EEC(5) limits the addition to the civil air registers of Member States of aeroplanes that only comply with the standards specified in Part II, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, second edition (1988); whereas that Directive specifies that the limitation on addition is only a first stage;


Whereas the programme of action of the European Communities on the environment(6) shows clearly the importance of the problem of noise and, in particular, the need to take action against noise due to air traffic;


Whereas, owing to the problem of growing congestion at Community airports, it is essential to ensure that the best use is made of existing facilities; whereas this will only be possible if environmentally acceptable aeroplanes are used;


Whereas the work undertaken by the Community in cooperation with other international bodies indicates that measures to limit the operation of aeroplanes which do not comply with the standards of Chapter 3 of Annex 16 must follow any non-addition rule in order for this to be of environmental benefit;


Whereas common rules for this purpose should be introduced on a reasonable time-scale to ensure a harmonized approach throughout the Community, supplementing existing rules; whereas this is particularly important in view of the recent trend towards progressive liberalization of European air traffic;


Whereas aeroplane noise should be further reduced, taking into account environmental factors, technical feasibility and economic consequences;


Whereas it is appropriate to restrict the operation of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes on Member States' registers to those which comply with the standards of Chapter 3 of Annex 16; whereas a timetable for the gradual withdrawal from Member States' registers of those aeroplanes which do not meet Chapter 3 standards would represent a facility both for airlines and for manufacturers;


Whereas special consideration should be given to the problems of developing nations;


Whereas in cases of technical or economic difficulty, it would be reasonable to grant limited exemptions,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


Article 1


1. The objective of this Directive is to restrict the operation of civil subsonic jet aeroplanes as specified in Article 2.


2. This Directive shall apply to aeroplanes with a maximum take-off mass of 34 000 kg or more with a certified maximum internal accommodation for the aeroplane type in question consisting of more than nineteen passenger seats, excluding any seats for crew only.


Article 2


1. Member States shall ensure that, as from 1 April 1995, civil subsonic jet aeroplanes fitted with engines having a by-pass ratio of less than two cannot operate at airports situated in their territory unless granted noise certification either:


(a) to the standards specified in Part II, Chapter 3, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, second edition (1988); or


(b) to the standards specified in Part II, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the aforesaid Convention, provided that they were first issued an individual certificate of airworthiness less than 25 years previously.


2. Member States shall ensure that, as from 1 April 2002, all civil subsonic jet aeroplanes operating from airports situated in their territory comply with the provisions of paragraph 1 (a).


3. The territory referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not include the overseas departments referred to in Article 227 (2) of the Treaty.


Article 3


Aeroplanes listed in the Annex shall be exempt from the provisions of Article 2 (1) (a) and (b) in so far as:


(a) such subsonic civil jet aeroplanes, granted noise certification to the standards specified in Part II, Chapter 2, Volume 1 of Annex 16 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, second edition (1988), operated into Community airports in a 12-month reference period between 1986 and 1990 selected in conjunction with the States concerned; and


(b) these aeroplanes were on the register of the developing nations shown in the Annex in the reference year and continue to be operated by natural or legal persons established in those countries.


Article 4


Member States may grant exemptions to the 25-year term specified in Article 2 (1) (b), for not more than three years in total, for aeroplanes in respect of which an airline demonstrates that the pursuit of its operations would otherwise be adversely affected to an unreasonable extent.


Article 5


1. Member States shall exempt from Article 2 (1) aeroplanes which do not meet the standards of Chapter 3 of Annex 16 but which can be altered to meet those standards, provided that:


(a) suitable conversion equipment exists and is actually available for the aeroplane type in question;


(b) aeroplanes fitted with such equipment meet the standards of Chapter 3 of Annex 16, as determined in accordance with the technical standards and procedures accepted by the Member States until such time as common standards and procedures are established at Community level;


(c) the airline has ordered the equipment by 1 April 1994;


(d) the airline has accepted the earliest delivery date for such alterations.


2. Member States may grant exemptions from Article 2 for aeroplanes of historical interest.


Article 6


Member States may grant, on the basis of the principle of one exemption for each aeroplane ordered, exemptions from the provisions of Article 2 (1) for aeroplanes where an order has been placed before 1 April 1994 for a replacement aeroplane that meets the standards of Chapter 3 of Annex 16, provided that the airline accepted the earlist delivery date.


Article 7


Subject to the approval of the competent authority of a Member State, airlines may not be required under Article 2 (1) to delete from the registers aeroplanes which do not meet the standards of Chapter 3 of Annex 16 at an annual rate equivalent to more than 10 % of their total civil subsonic jet fleet.


Article 8


In individual cases, Member States may permit the temporary use at airports situated in their territory of aeroplanes which cannot be operated on the basis of the other provisions of this Directive. This exemption should be limited to:


(a) aeroplanes whose operations are of such an exceptional nature that it would be unreasonable to withhold a temporary exemption;


(b) aeroplanes on non-revenue flights for the purposes of alterations, repair or maintenance.


Article 9


1. Any Member State granting exemptions under Article 4 to 7 shall inform the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission of the fact and of the grounds for its decision.


2. Any Member State shall recognize the exemptions granted by another Member State in respect of aeroplanes on the registers of the latter.


Article 10


1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 1 July 1992.


When Member States adopt these measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such a reference shall be laid down by Member States.


2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.


Article 11


This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 3688/92 of 21 December 1992 adapting to technical progress Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 on recording equipment in road transport


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85 of 20 December 1985 on recording equipment in road transport (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3572/90 (2), and in particular Articles 17 and 18 thereof,


Whereas it is necessary to eliminate the possibilities of fraud in the use of the electronic recording equipment in road transport;


Whereas in the light of experience and in view of the current state of the art it is possible to protect the connecting cables of the appliance to the impulse transmitter in order to make them inviolable;

Council Directive 92/42/EEC of 21 May 1992 on efficiency requirements for new hot-water boilers fired with liquid or gaseous fuels




COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/42/EEC of 21 May 1992 on efficiency requirements for new hot-water boilers fired with liquid or gaseous fuels


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas Decision 91/565/EEC (4) provides for the promotion of energy efficiency in the Community under the SAVE programme;


Whereas it is important to promote measures aimed at the progressive establishement of the internal market in the period up to 31 December 1992; whereas the internal market encompasses an area without internal frontiers, in which the free circulation of goods, persons, services and capital is assured;


Whereas the Council resolution of 15 January 1985 on the improvement of energy-saving programmes in the Member States (5) invites Member States to pursue and where necessary increase their efforts to promote the more rational use of energy by the further development of integrated energy-saving policies;


Whereas the Council resolution of 16 September 1986 concerns new Community energy-policy objectives for 1995 and convergence of the policies of the Member States (6), and in particular the objective of improving the efficiency of final energy demand by at least 20 %;


Whereas Article 130r of the Treaty provides that action by the Community relating to the environment shall have the objective of ensuring a prudent and rational utilization of natural resources;


Whereas it is appropriate to take as a base a high level of protection in proposals for the approximation of the provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States and concerning health, safety, environmental protection and consumer protection;


Whereas the Council resolution of 21 June 1989 declares 'that the Community should take proper account of potential climatic change linked to the greenhouse effect' (7) and the Council's conclusions of 29 October 1990 state that CO2 emissions in the year 2000 should be stabilized throughout the Community at their 1990 level;


Whereas the importance of the domestic and tertiary sector, which absorbs a major proportion of the final consumption of energy in the Community, is considerable;


Whereas this sector will become even more important through trends towards more central heating and a general increase in thermal comfort;


Whereas better boiler efficiency is in the consumer's interest; whereas energy saving will be reflected in fewer imports of hydrocarbons; whereas reduction in the Community's energy dependence will have a positive impact on its trade balance;


Whereas Council Directive 78/170/EEC of 13 February 1978 on the performance of heat generators for space heating and the production of hot water in new or existing non-industrial buildings and on the insulation of heat and domestic hot-water distribution in new non-industrial builings (8), has given rise to the establishment of substantially different efficiency levels between one Member State and another;


Whereas the requirement of high efficiency for hot-water boilers will reduce the range of technical properties of equipment placed on the market, thus facilitating series production and making for economies of scale; whereas the absence of a measure laying down energy requirements at a sufficiently high level may result, with the completion of the internal market, in a significant drop in the efficiency levels of heating installations through the spread on the market of low-efficiency boilers;


Whereas local climatic conditions and the energy and occupancy characteristics of buildings differ greatly within the Community; whereas Member States must take this diversity into account when determining the conditions for putting boilers into service in implementation of this Direcitve; whereas these circumstances justify the fact that Member States where back-boilers and boilers designed to be installed in the living space are widely installed at the date of the adoption of this Directive should continue to authorize, within specific limits, the placing on their markets and the putting into service of such boilers; whereas these arrangements should be subject to particular surveillance by the Commission;


Whereas this Directive, which is aimed at eliminating technical barriers with regard to boiler efficiency, must follow the new approach established by the Council resolution of 7 May 1985 (9) which specifically lays down that legislative harmonization is limited to the adoption, by means of directives based on Article 100 of the EEC Treaty, of the essential requirements with which products put on the market must conform and that 'these essential requirements shall be worded precisely enough in order to create legally binding obligations which can be enforced and to enable the certification bodies to certify products as being in conformity, having regard to those requirements in the absence of standards';


Having regard to Directive 83/189/EEC (10) laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations;


Having regard to Decision 90/683/EEC (11) concerning the modules for the various phases of the conformity assessment procedures which are intended to be used in the technical harmonization directives;


Whereas boilers complying with the efficiency requirements should bear the CE mark and, where appropriate, signs in order to enable them to move freely and to be put into service in accordance with their intended purpose within the Community;


Having regard to Directive 89/106/EEC (12) on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to construction products;


Whereas efficiency requirements to encourage the rational use of energy as laid down in Council Directive 90/396/EEC of 29 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to appliances burning gaseous fuels (13) should be established for the gas boilers referred to in this Directive,

Appropriate tolerances must be incorporated in the efficiency levels.


Article 6


1. Under the procedures laid down in Article 7, Member States may decide to apply a specific system of labels enabling the energy performance of boilers to be clearly ascertained. This system shall apply to boilers the efficiency of which is superior to the requirements for standard boilers set out in Article 5 (1).


If its efficiency at rated output and its efficiency at part load are equal to or greater than the relevant values for standard boilers, a boiler shall be awarded an '%amp% {K};' as set out in Annex I, section 2.


If its efficiency at rated output and its efficiency at part load are three or more points higher than the relevant values for standard boilers a boiler shall be awarded '%amp% {K};%amp% {K};'.


Every extra step of efficiency of three points at rated output and at part load will allow the attribution of an extra '%amp% {K};' as set out in Annex II.


2. Member States may not authorize any other label likely to be confused with those referred to in paragraph 1.


Article 7


1. Member States shall deem that boilers which comply with the harmonized standards, the reference numbers of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities and for which the Member States have published the reference numbers of the national standards transposing those harmonized standards, to be in conformity with the essential efficiency requirements stipulated in Article 5 (1). Such boilers must bear the CE mark referred to in Annex 1, section 1, and be accompanied by the EC declaration of conformity.


2. The conformity of series-produced boilers shall be certified by:


- examination of the efficiency of a boiler type in accordance with module B as described in Annex III,


- a declaration of conformity to the approved type in accordance with module C, D or E as described in Annex IV.


For boilers burning gaseous fuels, the procedures for assessing the conformity of their efficiency shall be those used to assess conformity to the safety requirements laid down in Directive 90/396/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to appliances burning gaseous fuels.


3. When appliances marketed separately are placed on the market, they must bear the CE mark and be accompanied by the EC declaration of conformity, which defines the parameters enabling them after assembly to achieve the useful efficiency levels laid down in Article 5 (1).


4. The CE mark of conformity to the requirements of this Directive and to the other provisions concerning the granting of the CE mark, and also the inscriptions specified in Annex I, shall be affixed on boilers in a visible, easily legible and indelible manner. The affixing on such products of any other mark, sign or indication liable to create confusion with the CE mark both as regards its significance or in its appearance shall be prohibited.

Council Directive 92/13/EEC of 25 February 1992 coordinating the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of Community rules on the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and telecommunications sectors




COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/13/EEC of 25 February 1992 coordinating the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of Community rules on the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and telecommunications sectors


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1) ,


In cooperation with the European Parliament(2) ,


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3) ,


Whereas Council Directive 90/531/EEC of 17 September 1990 on the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and telecommunications sectors(4) lays down rules for procurement procedures to ensure that potential suppliers and contractors have a fair opportunity to secure the award of contracts, but does not contain any specific provisions ensuring its effective application;


Whereas the existing arrangements at both national and Community levels for ensuring its application are not always adequate;


Whereas the absence of effective remedies or the inadequacy of existing remedies could deter Community undertakings from submitting tenders; whereas, therefore, the Member States must remedy this situation;


Whereas Council Directive 89/665/EEC of 21 December 1989 on the coordination of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the application of review procedures to the award of public supply and public works contracts(5) is limited to contract award procedures within the scope of Council Directive 71/305/EEC of 26 July 1971 concerning the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts(6) , as last amended by Directive 90/531/EEC, and Council Directive 77/62/EEC of 21 December 1976 coordinating procedures for the award of public supply contracts(7) , as last amended by Directive 90/531/EEC;


Whereas the opening-up of procurement in the sectors concerned to Community competition implies that provisions must be adopted to ensure that appropriate review procedures are made available to suppliers or contractors in the event of infringement of the relevant Community law or national rules implementing that law;


Whereas it is necessary to provide for a substantial increase in the guarantees of transparency and non-discrimination and whereas, for it to have tangible effects, effective and rapid remedies must be available;


Whereas account must be taken of the specific nature of certain legal orders by authorizing the Member States to choose between the introduction of different powers for the review bodies which have equivalent effects;


Whereas one of these options includes the power to intervene directly in the contracting entities' procurement procedures such as by suspending them, or by setting aside decisions or discriminatory clauses in documents or publications;


Whereas the other option provides for the power to exert effective indirect pressure on the contracting entities in order to make them correct any infringements or prevent them from committing infringements, and to prevent injury from occurring;


Whereas claims for damages must always be possible;


Whereas, where a claim is made for damages representing the costs of preparing a bid or of participating in an award procedure, the person making the claim is not be required, in order to obtain the reimbursement of his costs, to prove that the contract would have been awarded to him in the absence of such infringement;


Whereas the contracting entities which comply with the procurement rules may make this known through appropriate means; whereas this requires an examination, by independent persons, of procurement procedures and practices applied by those entities;


Whereas for this purpose an attestation system, allowing for a declaration on the correct application of the procurement rules, to be made in notices published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, is appropriate;


Whereas the contracting entities should have the opportunity of having recourse to the attestation system if they so wish; whereas the Member States must offer them the possibility of doing so; whereas they can do so either by setting up the system themselves or by allowing the contracting entities to have recourse to the attestation system established by another Member State; whereas they may confer the task of carrying out the examination under the attestation system to persons, professions or staff of institutions;


Whereas the necessary flexibility in the introduction of such a system is guaranteed by laying down the essential requirements for it in this Directive; whereas operational details should be provided in European Standards to which this Directive refers;


Whereas the Member States may need to determine operational details prior to, or in addition to, the rules contained in European Standards;


Whereas, when undertakings do not seek review, certain infringements may not be corrected unless a specific mechanism is put in place;


Whereas, accordingly, the Commission, when it considers that a clear and manifest infringement has been committed during a contract award procedure, should be able to bring it to the attention of the competent authorities of the Member State and of the contracting entity concerned so that appropriate steps are taken for the rapid correction of that infringement;


Whereas it is necessary to provide for the possibility of conciliation at Community level to enable disputes to be settled amicably;


Whereas the application in practice of this Directive should be reviewed at the same time as that of Directive 90/531/EEC on the basis of information to be supplied by the Member States concerning the functioning of the national review procedures;


Whereas this Directive must be brought into effect at the same time as Directive 90/531/EEC;


Whereas it is appropriate that the Kingdom of Spain, the Hellenic Republic and the Portuguese Republic are granted adequate additional periods to transpose this Directive, taking account of the dates of application of Directive 90/531/EEC in those countries,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


CHAPTER I Remedies at national level


Article 1


1. The Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that decisions taken by contracting entities may be reviewed effectively and, in particular, as rapidly as possible in accordance with the conditions set out in the following Articles and, in particular, Article 2 (8), on the grounds that such decisions have infringed Community law in the field or procurement or national rules implementing that law as regards:


(a) contract award procedures falling within the scope of Council Directive 90/531/EEC; and


(b) compliance with Article 3 (2) (a) of that Directive in the case of the contracting entities to which that provision applies.


2. Member States shall ensure that there is no discrimination between undertakings likely to make a claim for injury in the context of a procedure for the award of a contract as a result of the distinction made by this Directive between national rules implementing Community law and other national rules.


3. The Member States shall ensure that the review procedures are available, under detailed rules which the Member States may establish, at least to any person having or having had an interest in obtaining a particular contract and who has been or risks being harmed by an alleged infringement. In particular, the Member States may require that the person seeking the review must have previously notified the contracting entity of the alleged infringement and of his intention to seek review.


Article 2


1. The Member States shall ensure that the measures taken concerning the review procedures specified in Article 1 include provision for the powers:


either


(a) to take, at the earliest opportunity and by way of interlocutory procedure, interim measures with the aim of correcting the alleged infringement or preventing further injury to the interests concerned, including measures to suspend or to ensure the suspension of the procedure for the award of a contract or the implementation of any decision taken by the contracting entity; and


(b) to set aside or ensure the setting aside of decisions taken unlawfully, including the removal of discriminatory technical, economic or financial specifications in the notice of contract, the periodic indicative notice, the notice on the existence of a system of qualification, the invitation to tender, the contract documents or in any other document relating to the contract award procedure in question;


or


(c) to take, at the earliest opportunity, if possible by way of interlocutory procedures and if necessary by a final procedure on the substance, measures other than those provided for in points (a) and (b) with the aim of correcting any identified infringement and preventing injury to the interests concerned; in particular, making an order for the payment of a particular sum, in cases where the infringement has not been corrected or prevented.


Member States may take this choice either for all contracting entities or for categories of entities defined on the basis of objective criteria, in any event preserving the effectiveness of the measures laid down in order to prevent injury being caused to the interests concerned;


(d) and, in both the above cases, to award damages to persons injured by the infringement.


Where damages are claimed on the grounds that a decision has been taken unlawfully, Member States may, where their system of internal law so requires and provides bodies having the necessary powers for that purpose, provide that the contested decision must first be set aside or declared illegal.


2. The powers referred to in paragraph 1 may be conferred on separate bodies responsible for different aspects of the review procedure.


3. Review procedures need not in themselves have an automatic suspensive effect on the contract award procedures to which they relate.


4. The Member States may provide that, when considering whether to order interim measures, the body responsible may take into account the probable consequences of the measures for all interests likely to be harmed, as well as the public interest, and may decide not to grant such measures where their negative consequences could exceed their benefits. A decision no to grant interim measures shall not prejudice any other claim of the person seeking these measures.


5. The sum to be paid in accordance with paragraph 1 (c) must be set at a level high enough to dissuade the contracting entity from committing or persisting in an infringement. The payment of that sum may be made to depend upon a final decision that the infringement has in fact taken place.


6. The effects of the exercise of the powers referred to in paragraph 1 on a contract concluded subsequent to its award shall be determined by national law. Furthermore, except where a decision must be set aside prior to the award of damages, a Member State may provide that, after the conclusion of a contract following its award, the powers of the body responsible for the review procedures shall be limited to awarding damages to any person harmed by an infringement.


7. Where a claim is made for damages representing the costs of preparing a bid or of participating in an award procedure, the person making the claim shall be required only to prove an infringement of Community law in the field of procurement or national rules implementing that law and that he would have had a real chance of winning the contract and that, as a consequence of that infringement, that chance was adversely affected.


8. The Member States shall ensure that decisions taken by bodies responsible for review procedures can be effectively enforced.


9. Whereas bodies responsible for review procedures are not judicial in character, written reasons for their decisions shall always be given. Furthermore, in such a case, provision must be made to guarantee procedures whereby any allegedly illegal measures taken by the review body or any alleged defect in the exercise of the powers conferred on it can be the subject of judicial review or review by another body which is a court or tribunal within the meaning of Article 177 of the Treaty and independent of both the contracting entity and the review body.


The members of the independent body referred to in the first paragraph shall be appointed and leave office under the same conditions as members of the judiciary as regards the authority responsible for their appointment, their period of office, and their removal. At least the President of this independent body shall have the same legal and professional qualifications as members of the judiciary. The independent body shall take its decisions following a procedure in which both sides are heard, and these decisions shall, by means determined by each Member State, be legally binding.


CHAPTER 2 Attestation


Article 3


The Member States shall give contracting entities the possibility of having recourse to an attestation system in accordance with Articles 4 to 7.


Article 4


Contracting entities may have their contract award procedures and practices which fall within the scope of Directive 90/531/EEC examined periodically with a view to obtaining an attestation that, at that time, those procedures and practices are in conformity with Community law concerning the award of contracts and the national rules implementing the law.


Article 5


1. Attestors shall report to the contracting entity, in writing, on the results of their examination. They shall satisfy themselves, before delivering to the contracting entity the attestation referred to in Article 4, that any irregularities identified in the contracting entity's award procedures and practices have been corrected and measures have been taken to ensure that those irregularities are not repeated.


2. Contracting entities having obtained that attestation may include the following statement in notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities pursuant to Articles 16 to 18 of Directive 90/531/EEC:


'The contracting entity has obtained an attestation in accordance with Council Directive 92/13/EEC that, on ................., its contract award procedures and practices were in conformity with Community law and the national rules implementing that law.'


Article 6


1. Attestors shall be independent of the contracting entities and must be completely objective in carrying out their duties. They shall offer appropriate guarantees of relevant professional qualifications and experience.


2. Member States may identify any persons, professions or institutions whose staff, called upon the act as attestors, they regard as fulfilling the requirements of paragraph 1. For these purposes, Member States may require professional qualifications, at least at the level of a higher education diploma within the meaning of Directive 89/48/EEC(8) , which they regard as relevant, or provide that particular examinations of professional competence organized or recognized by the State offer such guarantees.


Article 7


The provisions of Articles 4, 5 and 6 shall be considered as essential requirements for the development of European standards on attestation.


CHAPTER 3 Corrective mechanism


Article 8


1. The Commission may invoke the procedures for which this Article provides when, prior to a contract being concluded, it considers that a clear and manifest infringement of Community provisions in the field of procurement has been committed during a contract award procedure fallig within the scope of Directive 90/531/EEC or in relation to Article 3 (2) (a) of that Directive in the case of the contracting entities to which that provision applies.


2. The Commission shall notify the Member States and the contracting entity concerned of the reasons which have led it to conclude that a clear and manifest infringement has been committed and request its correction by appropriate means.


3. Within 30 days of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 2, the Member States concerned shall communicate to the Commission:


(a) its confirmation that the infringement has been corrected; or


(b) a reasoned submission as to why no correction has been made; or


(c) a notice to the effect that the contract award procedure has been suspended either by the contracting entity on its own initiative or on the basis of the powers specified in Article 2 (1) (a).


4. A reasoned submission in accordance with paragraph 3 (b) may rely among other matters on the fact that the alleged infringement is already the subject of judicial review proceedings or of a review as referred to in Article 2 (9). In such a case, the Member State shall inform the Commission of the result of those proceedings as soon as it becomes known.


5. Where notice has been given that a contract award procedure has been suspended in accordance with paragraph 3 (c), the Member State concerned shall notify the Commission when the suspension is lifted or another contract procedure relating in whole or in part to the same subject matter is begun. That new notification shall confirm that the alleged infringement has been corrected or include an reasoned submission as to why no correction has been made.


CHAPTER 4 Conciliation


Article 9


1. Any person having or having had an interest in obtaining a particular contract falling within the scope of Directive 90/531/EEC and who, in relation to the procedure for the award of that contract, considers that he has been or risks being harmed by an alleged infringement of Community law in the field of procurement or national rules impelementing that law may request the application of the conciliation procedure provided for in Articles 10 and 11.


2. The request referred to in paragraph 1 shall be addressed in writing to the Commission or to the national authorities listed in the Annex. These authorities shall forward requests to the Commission as quickly as possible.


Article 10


1. Where the Commission considers, on the basis of the request referred to in Article 9, that the dispute concerns the correct application of Community law, it shall ask the contracting entity to state whether it is willing to take part in the conciliation procedure. If the contracting entity declines to take part, the Commission shall inform the person who made the request that the procedure cannot be initiated. If the contracting entity agrees, paragraphs 2 to 7 shall apply.


2. The Commission shall propose, as quickly as possible, a conciliator drawn from a list of independent persons accredited for this purpose. This list shall be drawn up by the Commission, following consultation of the Advisory Committee for Public Contracts or, in the case of contracting entities the activities of which are defined in Article 2 (2) (d) of Directive 90/531/EEC, following consultation of the Advisory Committee on Telecommunications Procurement.


Each party to the conciliation procedure shall declare whether it accepts the conciliator, and shall designate an additional conciliator. The conciliators may invite not more than two other persons as experts to advices them in their work. The parties to the conciliation procedure and the Commission may reject any expert invited by the conciliators.


3. The conciliators shall give the person requesting the application of the conciliation procedure, the contracting entity and any other candidate or tenderer participating in the relevant contract award procedure the opportunity to make representations on the matter either orally or in writing.


4. The conciliators shall endeavour as quickly as possible to reach an agreement between the parties which is in accordance with Community law.


5. The conciliators shall report to the Commission on their findings and on any result achieved.


6. The person requesting the application of the concilation procedure and the contracting entity shall have the right to terminate the procedure at any time.


7. Unless the parties decide otherwise, the person requesting the application of the conciliation procedure and the contracting entity shall be responsible for their own costs. In addition, they shall each bear half of the costs of the procedure, excluding the costs of intervening parties.


Article 11

Where, in relation to a particular contract award procedure, an interested person within the meaning of Article 9, other than the person requesting the conciliation procedure, is pursuing judicial review proceedings or other proceedings for review within the meaning of this Directive, the contracting entity shall inform the conciliators. These shall inform that person that a request has been made to apply the conciliation procedure and shall invite that person to indicate within a given time limit whether he agrees to participate in that procedure. If that person refuses to participate, the conciliators may decide, acting if necessary by a majority, to terminate the conciliation procedure if they consider that the participation of this person is necessary to resolve the dispute. They shall notify their decision to the Committee and give the reasons for it.


2. Action taken pursuant to this Chapter shall be without prejudice to:


(a) any action that the Commission or any Member State might take pursuant ot Articles 169 or 170 of the Treaty or pursuant to Chapter 3 of this Directive;

Council Regulation (EEC) No 2407/92 of 23 July 1992 on licensing of air carriers




COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2407/92 of 23 July 1992 on licensing of air carriers


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 84 (2) thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1) ,


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2) ,


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3) ,


Whereas it is important to establish an air transport policy for the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992 as provided for in Article 8a of the Treaty;


Whereas the internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured;


Whereas the application in the air transport sector of the principle of the freedom to provide services needs to take into account the specific characteristics of that sector;


Whereas in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2343/90 of 24 July 1990 on access for air carriers to scheduled intra-Community air service routes and on the sharing of passenger capacity between air carriers on scheduled air services between Member States(4) the Council decided to adopt for implementation not later than 1 July 1992 common rules governing the licensing of air carriers;


Whereas, however, it is necessary to allow Member States a reasonable period, until 1 January 1993, for the application of this Regulation;


Whereas it is important to define non-descriminatory requirements in relation to the location and control of an undertaking applying for a licence;


Whereas in order to ensure dependable and adequate service it is necessary to ensure that an air carrier is at all times operating at sound economic and high safety levels;


Whereas for the protection of users and other parties concerned it is important to ensure that air carriers are sufficiently insured in respect of liability risks;


Whereas within the internal market air carriers should be able to use aircraft owned anywhere in the Community, without prejudice to the responsibilities of the licensing Member State with respect to the technical fitness of the carrier;


Whereas it should also be possible to lease aircraft registered outside the Community for a short term or in exceptional circumstances, providing safety standards are equivalent to those applicable within the Community;


Whereas procedures for the granting of licences to air carriers should be transparent and non-discriminatory,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1

(a) the right to use all or part of the assets of an undertaking;


(b) rights or contracts which confer a decisive influence on the composition, voting or decisions of the bodies of an undertaking or otherwise confer a decisive influence on the running of the business of the undertaking.

2. An undertaking meeting the requirements of this Regulation shall be entitled to receive an operating licence. Such licence does not confer in itself any rights of access to specific routes or markets.


3. Without prejudice to Article 1 (2), no undertaking established in the Community shall be permitted within the territory of the Community to carry by air passengers, mail and/or cargo for remuneration and/or hire unless the undertaking has been granted the appropriate operating licence.

2. Without prejudice to agreements and conventions to which the Community is a contracting party, the undertaking shall be owned and continue to be owned directly or through majority ownership by Member States and/or nationals of Member States. It shall at all times be effectively controlled by such States or such nationals.


3. (a) Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 4, air carriers which have already been recognized in Annex I to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2343/90 and Council Regulation (EEC) No 294/91 of 4 February 1991 on the operation of air cargo services between Member States(5) shall retain their rights under this and associated Regulations as long as they meet the other obligations in this Regulation and they continue to be controlled directly or indirectly by the same third countries and/or by nationals of the same third country as those exercising such control at the time of adoption of this Regulation. Such control may, however, be transferred to Member States and/or to Member State nationals at any time.


(b) The possibility of buying and selling shares under subparagraph (a) does not cover nationals who have a significant interest in an air carrier of a third country.


4. Any undertaking which directly or indirectly participates in a controlling shareholding in an air carrier shall meet the requirements of paragraph 2.


5. An air carrier shall at all times be able on request to demonstrate to the Member State responsible for the operating licence that it meets the requirements of this Article.

Article 5


1. An applicant air transport undertaking to which an operating licence is granted for the first time must be able to demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the competent authorities of the licensing Member State that:


(a) it can meet at any time its actual and potential obligations, established under realistic assumptions, for a period of 24 months from the start of operations; and


(b) it can meet its fixed and operational costs incurred from operations according to its business plan and established under realistic assumptions, for a period of three months from the start of operations, without taking into account any income from its operations.


2. For the purpose of paragraph 1, each applicant shall submit a business plan for, at least, the first two years of operation. The business plan shall also detail the applicant's financial links with any other commercial activities in which the applicant is engaged either directly or through related undertakings. The applicant shall also provide all relevant information, in particular the data referred to in part A of the Annex.


3. An air carrier shall notify in advance to its licensing authority plans for: operation of a new scheduled service or a non-scheduled service to a continent or world region not previously served, changes in the type or number of aircraft used or a substantial change in the scale of its activities. It shall also notify in advance any intended mergers or acquisitions and shall notify its licensing authority within fourteen days of any change in the ownership of any single shareholding which represents 10 % or more of the total shareholding of the air carrier or of its parent or ultimate holding company. The submission of a 12 month business plan two months in advance of the period to which it refers shall constitute sufficient notice under this paragraph for the purpose of changes to current operations and/or circumstances which are included in that business plan.


4. If the licensing authority deems the changes notified under paragraph 3 to have a significant bearing on the finances of the air carrier, it shall require the submission of a revised business plan incorporating the changes in question and covering, at least, a period of 12 months from its date of implementation, as well as all the relevant information, including the data referred to in part B of the Annex, to assess whether the air carrier can meet its existing and potential obligations during that period of 12 months. The licensing authority shall take a decision on the revised business plan not later than three months after all the necessary information has been submitted to it.


5. Licensing authorities may, at any time and in any event whenever there are clear indications that financial problems exist with an air carrier licensed by them, assess its financial performance and may suspend or revoke the licence if they are no longer satisfied that the air carrier can meet its actual and potential obligations for a 12-month period. Licensing authorities may also grant a temporary licence pending financial reorganization of the air carrier provided safety is not at risk.


6. An air carrier shall provide to its licensing authority every financial year without undue delay the audited accounts relating to the previous financial year. At any time upon request of the licensing authority an air carrier shall provide the information relevant for the purposes of paragraph 5 and, in particular, the data referred to in part C of the Annex.


7. (a) Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 of this Article shall not apply to air carriers exclusively engaged in operations with aircraft of less than 10 tonnes mto w (maximum take off weight) and/or less than 20 seats. Such air carriers shall at all times be able to demonstrate that their net capital is at least ECU 80 000 or to provide when required by the licensing authority the information relevant for the purposes of paragraph 5. A Member State may nevertheless apply paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 to air carriers licensed by it that operate scheduled services or whose turnover exceeds ECU 3 million per year.


(b) The Commission may, after consulting the Member States, increase as appropriate the values referred to in subparagraph (a) if economic developments indicate the necessity of such a decision. Such change shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.


(c) Any Member State may refer the Commission's decision to the Council within a time limit of one month. The Council, acting by a qualified majority, may in exceptional circumstances take a different decision within a period of one month.


Article 6


1. Where the competent authorities of a Member State require, for the purpose of issuing an operating licence, proof that the persons who will continuously and effectively manage the operations of the undertaking are of good repute or that they have not been declared bankrupt, or suspend or revoke the licence in the event of serious professional misconduct or a criminal offence, that Member State shall accept as sufficient evidence in respect of nationals of other Member States the production of documents issued by competent authorities in the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the foreign national comes showing that those requirements are met.


Where the competent authorities of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which the foreign national comes do not issue the documents referred to in the first subparagraph, such documents shall be replaced by a declaration on oath - or, in Member States where there is no provision for declaration on oath, by a solemn declaration - made by the person concerned before a competent judicial or administrative authority or, where appropriate, a notary or qualified professional body of the Member State of origin or the Member State from which the person comes; such authority or notary shall issue a certificate attesting the authenticity of the declaration on oath or solemn declaration.


2. The competent authorities of Member States may require that the documents and certificates referred to in paragraph 1 be presented no more than three months after their date of issue.


Article 7


An air carrier shall be insured to cover liability in case of accidents, in particular in respect of passengers, luggage, cargo, mail and third parties.


Article 8


1. Ownership of aircraft shall not be a condition for granting or maintaining an operating licence but a Member State shall require, in relation to air carriers licensed by it that they habe one or more aircraft at their disposal, through ownership or any form of lease agreement.


2. (a) Without prejudice to paragraph 3, aircraft used by an air carrier shall be registered, at the option of the Member State issuing the operating licence, in its national register or within the Community.


(b) If a lease agreement for an aircraft registered within the Community has been deemed acceptable under Article 10, a Member State shall not require the registration of that aircraft on its own register if this would require structural changes to the aircraft.


3. In the case of short-term lease agreements to meet temporary needs of the air carrier or otherwise in exceptional circumstances, a Member State may grant waivers to the requirement of paragraph 2 (a).


4. When applying paragraph 2 (a) a Member State shall, subject to applicable laws and regulations, including those relating to airworthiness certification, accept on its national register, without any discriminatory fee and without delay, aircraft owned by nationals of other Member States and transfers from aircraft registers of other Member States. No fee shall be applied to transfer of aircraft in addition to the normal registration fee.


Air operator's certificates (AOC)


Article 9


1. The granting and validity at any time of an operating licence shall be dependent upon the possession of a valid AOC specifying the activities covered by the operating licence and complying with the criteria established in the relevant Council Regulation.

Article 10

For the purposes of ensuring safety and liability standards an air carrier using an aircraft from another undertaking or providing it to another undertaking shall obtain prior approval for the operation from the appropriate licensing authority. The conditions of the approval shall be part of the lease agreement between the parties.

- the country concerned must carry out a reform programme approved by the Bretton Woods institutions or implement programmes recognized as similar in concert with those institutions, although not necessarily backed by them, in line with the scale and effectiveness of the reforms at macro-economic level,


- account will be taken of the economic situation of the country, with particular reference to its level of indebtedness and debt service burden, the balance of payments situation and the availability of foreign currency, the budgetary situation, the monetary situation, per capita gross domestic product and the level of unemployment.


3. Projects eligible for financing shall take the form, for example, of:


(a) technical assistance measures linked to the support programme concerned, at macro-economic level and in sectors particularly affected by structural adjustment;


(b) sectoral or general import programmes or job creation programmes.


4. The aim of the import programmes is to contribute to the expansion of production capacity. The counterpart funds generated by the import programmes shall be used to finance measures aimed at mitigating the adverse social repercussions of structural adjustment, and, in particular, for job creation.


5. In analysing the situation of the countries eligible in accordance with paragraph 2 and on the basis of the criteria referred to in that paragraph, the Commission shall appraise the scope and effectiveness of the reforms undertaken in the areas covered by these criteria.


Aid given for structural adjustment must be linked directly to the adjustment operations and measures of the recipient country.


6. The procedures for the award of contracts must be sufficiently flexible for adaptation to the recipient country's normal administrative and commercial practices. In cases in the private sector where it is genuinely impractical to adhere to the procedures detailed in the Protocols, Articles 116, 117 and 118 of the Financial Regulation of 21 December 1977 applicable to the general budget of the European Communities (1) shall be applied and the precise procedures to be followed explicitly established on a case-by-case basis under the terms of individual finance proposals. For imports in the public and semi-public sectors, however, the usual procedures stipulated in the Protocols for the award of public contracts shall be followed.


7. The Commission shall inform the Member States, whenever necessary and at least once a year, of the implementation of structural adjustment operations and of any problem arising in connection with the continuing eligibility of these operations.

ANNEX I


I. GENERAL PROVISIONS


1. INTRODUCTION


General provisions with respect to reagents, equipment, expression of results, precision and test reports are described. Competent authorities of Member States and enforcement laboratories charged with the sampling and testing of milk must respect these provisions.


2. REAGENTS


2.1. Water


2.1.1. Wherever mention is made to water for solution, dilution or rinsing purposes, distilled water, deionized water or demineralized water of at least equivalent purity, shall be used unless otherwise specified.


2.1.2. Wherever reference is made to 'solution` or 'dilution` without further indication, 'solution in water` or 'dilution with water` is meant.


2.2. Chemicals


All chemicals used shall be of recognized analytical quality unless otherwise specified.


3. EQUIPMENT


3.1. Lists of equipment


The lists of equipment given in the different reference methods contain only those items with a specialized use and items to a particular specification.


3.2. Analytical balance


'Analytical balance` means a balance capable of weighing at 0,1 mg.


4. EXPRESSION OF RESULTS


4.1. Results


Unless otherwise specified, the results stated in the test report (6) shall be the mean arithmetic value obtained from two tests which satisfy the repeatability-criterion (5.1.1.) stated for that method. If the repeatability-criterion is not satisfied, the test must be repeated, if possible, or the result declared invalid.


4.2. Calculation of percentage


Except when otherwise specified, the result shall be calculated as a percentage by mass of the sample.


5. PRECISION CRITERIA: REPEATABILITY AND REPRODUCIBILITY


5.1. The precision criteria given in each method is defined as follows:


5.1.1. Repeatability (r) is the value below which the absolute difference between two single test results obtained with the same procedure on identical test material, under the same conditions (same operator, same apparatus, same laboratory, and a short interval of time) lies.


5.1.2. Reproducibility (R) is the value below which the absolute difference between two single test results obtained with the same procedure on identical test material, under different conditions (different operators, different apparatus, different laboratories and/or different time) lies.


5.1.3. Unless otherwise specified for each individual method the values for the repeatability- and reproducibility-criteria of each procedure represent the 95 % confidence level intervals as defined by ISO 5725: 2'ed. 1986.


5.1.4. The necessary collaborative trials and studies should be planned and conducted in accordance with international guidelines.


6. TEST REPORT


The test report shall specify the method of analysis used as well as the results obtained. In addition, it shall give any details of procedure used not specified in the method of analysis or which are optional, as well as any other circumstances that may have influenced the results obtained. The test report shall give all the information necessary for the complete identification of the sample.


II. SAMPLING OF HEAT-TREATED MILK


1. SCOPE AND FIELD OF APPLICATION


This procedure specifies the reference method of sampling, transport and storage of samples of heat treated milk.


2. GENERAL


Sampling of heat-treated milk in tanks etc., shall be carried out by a skilled operator who has had suitable training before undertaking the sampling of milk.


If they consider it appropriate, the competent authorities or testing laboratory shall instruct sampling personnel in sampling techniques to ensure that the sample is representative of, and in conformity with, the entire batch.


If they consider it appropriate, the competent authorities or testing laboratory shall instruct sampling personnel on marking the sample to ensure the unambiguous identity of the sample.


3. SAMPLING EQUIPMENT


3.1. General


Sampling equipment shall be made of stainless steel, or other suitable material of adequate strength and of a construction suitable for the intended purpose (mixing, sampling etc.). Plungers and agitators for mixing liquids in containers shall have a sufficient area to produce adequate mixing of the product, but without causing the development of a rancid flavour. Dippers must have a solid handle of sufficient length to enable a sample at any depth of the container to be obtained. The capacity of the dipper shall be not less than 50 ml.


Sample containers and closures should be of glass, suitable metals or plastics.


The materials of which sampling equipment (including containers and closures) is constructed must not cause any change in the sample which could affect the results of the examinations. All surfaces of sampling equipment and sample containers shall be clean and dry, smooth and free from crevices, and corners shall be rounded.


4. SAMPLING TECHNIQUE


4.1. General


Irrespective of the tests to be performed, the milk shall be thoroughly mixed prior to sampling, by either manual or mechanical means.


The sample shall be taken immediately after mixing while the milk is still agitated.


The volume of the sample shall be adequate to the testing requirements. The capacity of the sample containers used shall be such that they are filled almost completely by the sample, thus allowing proper mixing of the contents before testing, but avoiding churning during transport.


4.2. Manual sampling


4.2.1. Sampling a divided bulk


Where the quantity of milk to be sampled is in more than one container, take a representative quantity from each container and note the quantity of milk to which each sample relates. Unless the samples from each container are to be tested individually, mix portions of these representative quantities in amounts which are proportional to the quantity in the container from which each sample was taken. Take sample(s) from these bulked proportionate amounts after mixing.


4.2.2. Sampling from large vessels - Storage, rail and road tanks


4.2.2.1. Mix the milk by an appropriate procedure, before sampling.


To mix the contents of large vessels or of storage, rail or road tanks, the use of mechanical agitation is advised (4.2.2.2.).


The extent of mixing shall be appropriate to the period of time over which the milk has been at rest. The efficiency of the procedure of mixing applied in any particular circumstances shall be demonstrated as being adequate for the purposes of the analysis envisaged; the criterion of mixing efficiency particularly influences the similarity between analytical results from samples taken either from different parts of the consignments, or from the outlet of the tank at intervals during discharge. A procedure of mixing milk (untreated milk or whole milk) shall be considered efficient if the difference in fat content between two samples, taken under these conditions, is less than 0,1 %.


In a large vessel with a bottom discharge outlet there may be, at the discharge point, a small quantity of milk which is not representative of the whole contents even after mixing. Therefore samples should preferably be taken through a manhole. If samples are taken from the discharge outlet, run off sufficient milk to ensure that the samples are representative of the whole.


4.2.2.2. Mixing of the contents of large vessels or of storage, rail or road tanks can be carried out:


- by a mechanical agitator built into the tanks and driven by an electric motor;


- by a propellor or agitator driven by an electric motor and placed on the manhole with the agitator suspended in the milk;


- in the case of rail or road tankers by recirculation of the milk through the transfer hose attached to the tanker unloading pumps and inserted through the manhole;


- by clean filtered compressed air. In this case, minimal air pressure and volume should be used to prevent the development of rancid flavour.


4.3. Sampling of heat-treated milk for direct consumption in retail-packings


Samples of heat-treated milk for direct consumption in retail packages are to be the complete sealed package. If possible, the samples must be taken from the packaging machine or cold room in the treatment establishment as soon as possible after processing (for pasteurized milk on the same day as processing).


The samples are taken from each type of heat-treated milk (pasteurized, UHT-treated and sterilized) in numbers corresponding to the examinations which will be made and in accordance with instructions laid down by the testing laboratory or other competent authority.


5. IDENTIFICATIONS OF THE SAMPLE


The sample shall be marked with an identification code so that it can be readily identified using instructions given by the testing laboratory or competent authority.


6. PRESERVATION, TRANSPORT AND STORAGE OF SAMPLES


In accordance with the competent national authority, instructions concerning the conditions of preservation (chemical, temperature), transport, storage and time between sampling and analysis of milk shall be prepared by the testing laboratory according to the type of milk and the procedure of analysis to be used.


In the instruction the following points shall be included:


- During transport and storage, precautions shall be taken to prevent exposure to contaminating odours and to direct sunlight. If the container used for samples is transparent, it shall be stored in a dark place.

I. DETERMINATION OF TOTAL SOLIDS CONTENT


1. SCOPE AND FIELD OF APPLICATION


This procedure specifies the reference method for the determination of the total solids content of milk.


2. DEFINITION


Total solids content: The mass remaining after completion of the specified drying procedure and expressed as a percentage by mass.


3. PRINCIPLE


Evaporation of the water from a test portion at a temperature of 1022 oC in a drying oven.


4. APPARATUS AND GLASSWARE


Usual laboratory equipment and, in particular:


4.1. Analytical balance


4.2. Desiccator, provided with an efficient desiccant (for example freshly dried silica gel with a water content indicator).


4.3. Drying oven, ventilated, thermostatically controlled at 1022 oC throughout the total working space.


4.4. Flat-bottom dishes, of height 20 to 25 mm, diameter 50 to 75 mm, and of appropriate material provided with well-fitting, readily removable lids.


4.5. Boiling water bath


4.6. Homogenizer


5. PREPARATION OF THE TEST SAMPLE


Bring the sample of milk to a temperature of 20 to 25 oC. Thoroughly mix to ensure a homogeneous distribution of the fat throughout the sample. Avoid agitating so vigorously as to cause frothing of the milk or churning of the fat. If it is found difficult to disperse the cream layer, warm slowly to between 25 and 40 oC and with careful mixing, incorporate any cream adhering to the container. Cool the sample quickly to 20-25 oC.


If desired, a homogenizer may be used to assist the dispersion of the fat.


Correct results cannot be expected if the sample contains separated liquid fat or visible separate irregularly shaped white particles adhering to the walls of the container.

II. DETERMINATION OF FAT CONTENT


1. SCOPE AND FIELD OF APPLICATION


This procedure specifies the reference method for the determination of the fat content of raw milk and of whole milk, partly skimmed milk and skimmed milk.


2. DEFINITION


Fat content of milk: all the material as determined by the specified method. It is expressed as a percentage by mass.


3. PRINCIPLE


An ammoniacal ethanolic solution of a test portion is extracted with diethyl ether and light petroleum, the solvents removed by distillation or evaporation, and the mass of the extracted material soluble in light petroleum, is determined. (The procedure is usually known as the Roese-Gottlieb method).


4. REAGENTS


All reagents shall be of recognized analytical quality and shall leave no appreciable residue when taken through a blank test.


To test the quality of the reagents, carry out a determination as specified in 6.3. Use an empty flask, beaker or metal dish (5.8.) for weighing, prepared as specified in 6.4. as a tare (to allow correction for the effects on the weighing result, caused by changes in the atmospheric conditions). If the residue, corrected for the apparent change of the mass of the tare is larger than 2,5 mg, determine the residue or the solvents separately by evaporating 100 ml diethyl ether (4.4.) and 100 ml light petroleum (4.5.) respectively. Also use a tare for the weighing. When the residue is larger than 2,5 mg, cleanse the solvent by means of distillation or replace the solvent.


4.1. Ammonia solution, containing approximately 25 % (m/m) of NH3. A more concentrated ammonia solution may also be used (see 6.5.1. and A.1.5.1.).


4.2. Ethanol, at least 94 % (v/v). Ethanol denatured by methanol may be used provided it is certain that the results of the determination are not affected.


4.3. Congo red or Cresol red solution


Dissolve 1 g of Congo red or Cresol red in water and dilute to 100 ml.


Note: The use of this solution, which allows the interface between the solvent and aqueous layers to be seen more clearly, is optional (see 6.5.2.). Other aqueous colour solutions may be used provided that they do not affect the result of the determination.


4.4. Diethylether, free from peroxides not containing more than 2 mg/kg of antioxidants, and meeting the requirements of the blank test (6.3.).


4.5. Light petroleum, having any boiling range between 30 and 60 oC.


4.6 Mixed solvent, prepared shortly before use by mixing equal volumes of diethyl ether (4.4.) and light petroleum (4.5.).

Usual laboratory equipment and, in particular:


5.1. Analytical balance


5.2. Centrifuge, in which the fat-extraction flasks or tubes (5.6.) can be spun at a rotational frequency of 500 to 600 rev min 1 to produce a gravitational field of 80 to 90 g at the outer end of the flasks or tubes.


Note: The use of a centrifuge is optional (6.5.5.).


5.3. Distillation or evaporation apparatus, to permit the solvents and ethanol to be distilled from the flasks or to be evaporated from beakers and dishes (sec 6.5.12. and 6.5.15.) at a temperature not exceeding 100 oC.

5.6. Mojonnier-type fat extraction flasks


Note: It is also possible to use fat-extraction tubes with siphon or wash-bottle fittings, but the procedure is then different and is specified in the Appendix.


The flasks (or tubes) shall be provided with ground-glass or good quality bark corks or other stoppers unaffected by the reagents used. Rark corks shall be extracted with the diethyl ether (4.4.) kept in water at 60 oC or more for at least 15 minutes, and shall then be allowed to cool in water so that they are saturated when used.


5.7. Rack, to hold the fat-extraction flasks (or tubes) (see 5.6.).


5.8. Wash bottle, suitable for use with the mixed solvent (4.6.). A plastic wash bottle shall not be used.


5.9. Fat-collecting vessels, for example boiling flasks (flat-bottom), or Erlenmeyer flasks of capacity 125-250 ml or metal dishes. If metal dishes are used, they shall preferably be of stainless steel, shall be flat-bottomed, preferably with a spout, and shall have a diameter of 80 to 100 mm and a height of approximately 50 mm.

Note: The alternative procedure using fat-extraction tubes with siphon or wash-bottle fittings (see the note to 5.6.) is described in the Appendix.


6.1. Preparations of the test sample


Adjust the temperature of the laboratory sample to approximately 35-40 oC for 15 minutes, by means of a water bath is necessary. Mix the sample thoroughly, but gently, by repeatedly inverting the sample bottle without causing frothing or churning, and cool quickly to approximately 20 oC.


6.2. Test portion


Mix the test sample (6.1.) by gently inverting the bottle three or four times and immediately weigh, to the nearest 1 mg, 10 to 11 g of the test sample, directly or by difference, into one of the extraction flasks (5.6.).


The test portion shall be delivered as completely as possible into the lower (small) bulb of the extraction flasks.


6.3. Blank test


Carry out the blank test simultaneously with the determination using the same procedure and same reagents, but replacing the test portion by 10 to 11 ml of water.


The change in apparent mass of the fat collecting vessel, corrected for apparent change in mass of the control vessel, should not be greater than 2,5 mg.


6.4. Preparation of fat-collecting vessel


Dry a vessel (5.9.) together with a few boiling aids (5.10.) to promote gentle boiling during the subsequent removal of solvent in the oven (5.4.) for one hour. Allow the vessel to cool (not in a desiccater but protected from dust) to the temperature of the weighing room (for glass vessels allow at least one hour, for metal dishes allow at least 30 minutes). Taking care to avoid temperature variations, use tongs to place the vessel on the balance and weigh to the nearest 0,1 mg.


6.5. Determination


6.5.1. Add 2 ml of the ammonia solution (4.1.) or an equivalent volume of a more concentrated ammonia solution and mix thoroughly with the test portion in the small bulb of the flask. After the addition of the ammonia, carry out the determination without delay.


6.5.2. Add 10 ml of the ethanol (4.2.) and mix gently but thoroughly by allowing the contents of the flask to flow backwards and forwards between the two bulbs; avoid bringing the liquid too near to the neck of the flask. If desired, add two drops of the Congo red or Cresol red solution (4.3.).


6.5.3. Add 25 ml of diethyl ether (4.4.), close the flask with a cork saturated with water or with a stopper wetted with water (see 5.6.), and shake the flask vigorously, but not excessively (in order to avoid the formation of persistant emulsions), for one minute with the flask in a horizontal position and the small bulb extending upwards. Periodically allow the liquid in the large bulb to run into the small bulb. If necessary, cool the flask in running water, then carefully remove the cork or stopper and rinse it and the neck of the flask with a little of the mixed solvent (4.6.) using the wash bottle (5.8.) so that the rinsings run into the flask.


6.5.4. Add 25 ml of light petroleum (4.5.), close the flask with the rewetted cork or stopper (rewet by dipping in water), and shake the flask gently for 30 seconds as described in 6.5.3.


6.5.5. Centrifuge the closed flask for one to five minutes at a rotational frequency of 500 to 600 rev min 1 (5.2.). If a centrifuge is not available (see note to 5.2.) allow the closed flask to stand in the rack (5.7.) for at least 30 minutes until the supernatant layer is clear and distinctly separated from the aqueous layer. If necessary, cool the flask in running water.


6.5.6. Carefully remove the cork or stopper and rinse it and the inside of the neck of the flask with a little of the mixed solvent (4.6.) so that the rinsings run into the flask.


If the interface is below the bottom of the neck of the flask, raise it slightly above this level by gently adding water down the side of the flask to facilitate decantation of solvent.


6.5.7. Holding the extraction flask by the small bulb, carefully decant as much as possible of the supernatant layer into the prepared fat-collecting vessel (6.4.) containing a few boiling aids (5.10.) in the case of flasks (optional with metal dishes), avoiding decantation of any of the aqueous layer.


6.5.8. Rinse the outside of the neck of the extraction flask with a little of the mixed solvent (4.6.), collecting the rinsings in the fat-collecting vessel and taking care that the mixed solvent does not spread over the outside of the extraction flask.


If desired, the solvent or part of the solvent may be removed from the vessel by distillation or evaporation as described in 6.5.12.


6.5.9. Add 5 ml of the ethanol (4.2.) to the contents of the extraction flask, using the ethanol to rinse the inside of the neck of the flask and mix as decribed in 6.5.2.


6.5.10. Carry out a second extraction by repeating the operations described in 6.5.3. to 6.5.8. inclusive, but using only 15 ml of diethyl ether (4.4.) and 15 ml of light petroleum (4.5.); use the ether to rinse the inside of the neck of the extraction flask. If necessary, raise the interface to the middle of the stem of the flask to enable the final decantation of solvent to be as complete as possible.


6.5.11. Carry out a third extraction by further repeating the operations described in 6.5.3. to 6.5.8. inclusive, but using only 15 ml of diethyl ether (4.4.) and 15 ml of light petroleum (4.5.); use the ether to rinse the inside of the neck of the extraction flask. If necessary, raise the interface to the middle of the neck of the flask to enable the final decantation of solvent to be as complete as possible.


The third extraction can be omitted for skimmed milk.


6.5.12. Remove the solvents (including ethanol) as completely as possible from the flask by distillation, or from the beaker or dish by evaporation (5.3.), rinsing the inside of the neck of the flask with a little of the mixed solvent (4.6.) before commencing the distillation.


6.5.13. Heat the fat-collecting vessel (with the flask placed on its side to allow solvent vapour to escape) for one hour in the oven (5.4.). Remove the fat-collecting vessel from the oven, allow to cool (not in a desiccator, but protected from dust) to the temperature of the weighing room (for glass vessels allow at least one hour, for metal dishes allow at least 30 minutes) and weigh to the nearest 0,1 mg.


Do not wipe the vessel immediately before weighing. Place the vessel on the balance using tongs and avoid, in particular, temperature variations.


6.5.14. Repeat the operations described in 6.5.13. until the mass of the fat-collecting vessel decreases by 0,5 mg or less, or increases, between two successive weighings. Record the minimum mass observed as the mass of the fat-collecting vessel and extracted matter.


6.5.15. Add 25 ml of light petroleum to the fat-collecting vessel in order to verify whether or not the extracted matter is wholly soluble. Warm gently and swirl the solvent until all the fat is dissolved.


If the extracted matter is wholly soluble in the light petroleum, take the mass of fat as the difference between the final mass of the vessel containing the extracted matter (6.5.14.) and its initial mass (6.4.).


6.5.16. If the extracted matter is not wholly soluble in the light petroleum, or in case of doubt, extract the fat completely from the vessel by repeatedly washing with warm light petroleum.


Allow any trace of insoluble material to settle and carefully decant the light petroleum without removing any insoluble material. Repeat this operation three more times, using the light petroleum to rinse the inside of the neck of the vessel.


Finally, rinse the outside of the top of the vessel with mixed solvent so that the solvent does not spread over the outside of the vessel. Remove light petroleum vapour from the vessel by heating the vessel for one hour in the oven, allow to cool and weigh, as described in 6.5.13. and 6.5.14.


Take the mass of fat as the difference between the mass determined in 6.5.14. and this final mass.


7. EXPRESSION OF RESULTS

DETERMINATION OF TOTAL NON-FAT SOLIDS


1. SCOPE AND FIELD OF APPLICATION


This procedure specifies the reference method for the determination of the content of total non-fat solids in heat-treated milk.


2. DEFINITION AND CALCULATION


The total non-fat solids content must be expressed as a percentage by mass.


The content of non-fat solids is:


The content of total solids (see Section I) minus the content of fat (see Section II).


IV.


DETERMINATION OF TOTAL NITROGEN CONTENT


1. SCOPE AND FIELD OF APPLICATION


This procedure specifies the reference method for the determination of the total nitrogen content of raw milk and of whole milk, partly skimmed milk and skimmed milk.


2. DEFINITION


The total nitrogen content of milk: the nitrogen content, expressed in per cent by mass, as determined by the specified Kjeldahl method.


3. PRINCIPLE


A weighed quantity of the milk sample is digested with concentrated sulphuric acid and potassium sulphate and copper (II) sulphate as catalyst, in order to convert the nitrogen of the organic compounds into ammonium sulphate. The ammonia is released by the addition of sodium hydroxide solution and then distilled and absorbed in a boric acid solution. This is titrated with an acid solution.


4. REAGENTS


4.1. Potassium sulphate (K2SO4).


4.2. Copper sulphate solution. Dissolve 5,0 g of copper (II) sulphate pentahydrate (CuSO4, 5H2O) in water and dilute to 100 ml (at 20 oC) in a volumetric flask.


4.3. Sulphuric acid, at least 98,0 % (m/m) H2SO4.


4.4. Sodium hydroxide solution, 47 % (m/m) 704 g NaOH/l (20 oC).


Note: A less concentrated sodium hydroxide solution may be used for example: 40 % (m/m) 572 g/l, 20 oC; or 30 % (m/m) 399 g/l, 20 oC.


4.5. Boric acid solution. Dissolve 40 g of boric acid (H3BO3) in one litre of hot water, allow to cool, and store in a borosilicate glass bottle.


4.6. Indicator solution. Dissolve 0,01 g methyl red, 0,02 g bromothymol blue and 0,06 g bromocresol green in 100 ml of ethanol. Store the solution in a brown closed bottle, in a cool, dark place.


4.7. Volumetric solution


c (1/2 H2SO4) or c (HCl) = 0,1 mol/l standardized to the nearest 0,0001 mol/l.


4.8. Nitrogen-free sucrose.


4.9. Ammonium salt, pure, such as ammonium oxalate (NH4)2C2O4, H2O or ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4.


4.10. Tryptophan (C11H12N2O2), phenacetin (C10H7CH2CONH2) or lysine mono- or di-hydrochloride


(C6H14N2O2 7 HCl or C6H14N2O2 7 2HCl).


Note: The purity of reagents in 4.9. and 4.10. should be of higher quality than 'analytical grade`. If available, certified ammonium salt solution (4.9.) should be used.


5. APPARATUS AND GLASSWARE


Usual laboratory equipment and, in particular:


5.1. Kjeldahl flasks of capacity 500 ml.


5.2. Suitable boiling aids, for example, glass beads of diameter approximately 5 mm, Hengar granules, pumice.


5.3 Burette or automatic pipette, to deliver 1,0 ml.


5.4. Graduated measuring cylinders, glass, of capacities 50, 100 and 250 ml.


5.5. Digestion apparatus in an inclined position (approximately 45o), with electric heaters or gas burners that do not heat the flasks above the level of their contents, with a fume extraction system.


5.6. Distillation apparatus, made of borosilicate glass, to which a Kjeldahl flask (5.1.) can be fitted, consisting of an efficient splash-head connected to an efficient condenser with straight inner tube and an outlet tube attached to its lower end; the connecting tubing and stopper (s) shall be close-fitting and preferably of neoprene rubber.


5.7. Pipette or automatic pipette, to deliver 0,10 ml.


5.8. Conical flasks, of capacity 500 ml, graduated at 200 ml.


5.9. Burette of capacity 50 ml, gratuated in 0,1 ml, maximum error 0,05 ml.


5.10. Magnifying lens, for reading the burette (5.9.).


5.11. pH meter


5.12. Automatic burette.


6. PROCEDURE


6.1. To the Kjeldahl flask (5.1.) add boiling aid (5.2.) (eg. three glass beads), 15 g of potassium sulphate (4.1.), 1,0 ml of copper sulphate solution (4.2.), approximately 5 g of milk sample (weighed to the nearest 0,001 g) and 25 ml of sulphuric acid (4.3.). Use the acid to wash down any copper sulphate solution, potassium sulphate or milk on the neck of the flask, and gently mix the contents of the flask.


Note: Because organic matter consumes sulphuric acid during boiling, use 30 ml of H2SO4 (4.3.), instead of 25 ml for digestion, if the milk contains more than 5,0 % (m/m) of fat. This should also be done in the blank test.


6.2. Heat each Kjeldahl flask on the digestion apparatus (5.5.), very gently at first so that all the black froth stays within the bulb. When the initial frothing has ceased and copious white vapour appears, boil vigorously (acid vapour will condense half-way up the neck of the flask) until no black particles remain and until the digest becomes clear pale blue-green in colour. Then boil gently for at least 1,5 hours. Note the following requirements:


(a) The time for the digest to become clear should not be more than one hour, and the total digestion time shall not be less than 2,5 hours. If more than one hour is necessary to achieve clearing, the total digestion time shall be increased accordingly.


(b) The added potassium sulphate promotes the digestion as it raises the boiling temperature of the mixture. If the residual volume of H2SO4 is less than approximately 15 ml at the end of the digestion time, nitrogen may have been lost because of excessive heating. If heating by gas, heat the flask on a plate of heat-insulating material, provided with a circular opening of such a diameter that the free flame only touches the part of the flask that is below the surface of the liquid contents (5.5.).


(c) If black particles enter the neck of the flask and are not all washed down into the bulb by the acid refluxing during the inital stages of the vigorous boiling period (this may be facilitated by rotating the flask) allow the flask to cool sufficiently and carefully wash with the minimum of water. Then continue the digestion as described above.


6.3. When the Kjeldahl flasks are cool, add 300 ml of water (see note) to each so as to wash carefully down the neck of the flask, and mix the contents thoroughly ensuring that the crystals which have separated out are dissolved. Add some boiling aid (5.2.) to ensure uniform boiling. Then to each flask, add 70 ml of sodium hydroxide solution (4.4.) (see note) by gently pouring the solution down the inclined neck of the flask to form a bottom layer in the bulb; do not wet the top of the neck with the sodium hydroxide solution.


Note: It is necessary that the combined volume of water and sodium hydroxide solution total 370 ml to enable approximately 150 ml of distillate to be collected just before irregular boiling ('bumping`) ensues (6.4.). Thus, if a larger equivalent volume of a sodium hydroxide solution which is less concentrated than 47 % (m/m) is added, the volume of water added shall be reduced accordingly. For example, if 85 ml of 40 % (m/m) or 125 ml of 30 % (m/m) sodium hydroxide solution are to be added, the volume of water added shall be 285 ml or 245 ml respectively.


6.4. Immediately connect each Kjeldahl flask to a distillation apparatus (5.6.). Ensure that the tip of the condenser outlet-tube is immersed in 50 ml of boric acid solution (4.5.) together with 0,20 ml (5 6 drops) of indicator solution (4.6.) all contained in a conical flask (5.8.). Swirl the contents of each Kjeldahl flask to mix thoroughly and boil, but gently at first to prevent excessive frothing. When 100 to 125 ml of distillate have been collected, lower each conical flask until the tip of the condenser outlet-tube is approximately 40 mm above the 200 ml mark. Continue each distillation until irregular boiling ('bumping`) starts and then immediately stop the heating. Disconnect each Kjeldahl flask and rinse the tip of each condenser outlet-tube with a little water, collecting the rinsings in the conical flask. Note the following requirements:


(a) The distillation rate shall be such that approximately 150 ml of distillate are collected when irregular boiling ('bumping`) starts, the volume of the contents of each conical flask will then be approximately 200 ml.


(b) The efficiency of each condenser should be such that the temperature of the contents of each conical flask does not exceed 25 oC during the distillation.


6.5 Titrate each distillate with standard volumetric solution (4.7.) until the pH is 4,60,1, using a pH meter and if desired an automatic burette. Addition of an indicator helps to check whether the titration is proceeding correctly. Take each burette reading to the nearest 0.01 ml with the aid of a magnifying lens (5.10.) avoiding errors of parallax.


The titrating may be carried out with the indicator only. Titrate until the colour of the distillate corresponds to that of a solution recently prepared from 150 ml of water to which has been added 50 ml of the boric acid solution and 0,20 ml of the indicator contained in a conical flask (5.8).


6.6. Carry out a blank test according to 6.1. to 6.5. inclusive, taking 5 ml of distilled water together with about 0,1 g of sucrose (4.8.) through the procedure instead of the milk sample.


Note: The titration of the blank distillate will require only a very small volume of the standard volumetric solution (4.7.).


6.7. Regularly check the accuracy of the procedure by using two recovery trials following the procedure according to 6.1. to 6.5. inclusive.


6.7.1. Check that no loss of nitrogen occurs as a result of excessive heat or mechanical leaks during distillation, by using a test portion of 0,15 g of ammonium oxalate or sulphate (4.9.) weighed to the nearest 0,001 g together with 0,1 g of sucrose (4.8.).


The percentage of nitrogen recovered shall be between 99,0 and 100,0 %.


Lower or higher results will indicate failures in the procedure and/or inaccurate concentration of the standard solution (4.7.).


6.7.2. Check that the digestion procedure is sufficient to release all the protein nitrogen by using a test portion of 0,20 g of pure tryptophan, 0,35 g of phenacetin or 0,20 g of lysine hydrochloride (4.10.). All weighings should be to the nearest 0,001 g. At least 98-99 % of the nitrogen should be recovered.


7. SAFETY PRECAUTIONS


When working with concentrated sulphuric acid and sodium hydroxide and when handling Kjeldahl flasks, always wear a laboratory coat, safety goggles and acid resistant gloves.


During distillation, never leave Kjeldahl flasks unattended. Because of potential danger, stop distillation immediately if flask contents 'bump` too vigorously. If the power goes off for more than two to three minutes, lower the collecting flask so that the distillation tip is out of the liquid.

m


where:


WN = the nitrogen content.


V = the volume in millilitres of the standard volumetric solution of acid used in the determination.


VO = the volume in millilitres of the standard volumetric solution of acid used in the blank test.


c = the concentration, expressed as moles per litre of the acid standard volumetric solution (4.7.).


m = the mass in grams of the test portion.


Round off the result to the nearest 0,001 g per 100 g.


8.2. Precision


8.2.1. Repeatability (r): 0,007 g per 100 g.


8.2.2. Reproducibility (R): 0,015 g per 100 g.


9. MODIFIED PROCEDURES


9.1. Use a block digestion apparatus fitted with cylindrical flasks, instead of the digestion apparatus and the Kjeldahl flasks described in 5.5. and 5.1. In this case to identify potential trouble, each spot has to be checked individually (6.7.).


9.2. Use of steam distillation instead of direct heating of the flasks (6.4.). When the apparatus does not allow the use of distilled water, care should be taken that the water does not contain acid or alkaline volatiles.


9.3. A test portion of 1 g of milk (semi-macro Kjeldahl) can be used instead of 5 g (6.1.) provided:


- the amounts of the reagents used for mineralization (6.1.): H2SO4, CuSO4 7 5 H2O, K2SO4, are reduced to the same ratio (1/5).


- the total digestion time (6.2.) is reduced to 75 minutes.


- the amount of sodium hydroxide solution (6.3.) is reduced to the same ratio (1/5).


- an acid standard solution (4.7.) of lower concentration (0,02 to 0,03 mol/l) has to be used.


Note: Using one or more of these options is acceptable only if the repeatability value (8.2.1.) and the two accuracy tests results (6.7.) are in accordance with the requirements given in this method.


V. DETERMINATION OF PROTEIN CONTENT


1. SCOPE AND FIELD OF APPLICATION


This procedure specifies the reference method for the determination of the content of protein in heat treated milk (Article 3 A3 in Directive 85/397/EEC).


2. DEFINITION


Protein content: The value obtained by multiplying the total nitrogen content, expressed as a percentage by mass, determined in accordance with the method described in Section IV(3) by an appropriate factor (3.).


3. CALCULATION


Protein content of milk as percentage by mass = 6,38 x total N content of milk %.


VI. DETERMINATION OF SPECIFIC MASS


1. SCOPE AND FIELD OF APPLICATION


This procedure specifies the reference method for the determination of the specific mass at 20 oC of raw milk and of whole milk, partly skimmed milk and skimmed milk.


2. DEFINITION


The specific mass of the milk is the ratio of the mass of a certain volume of milk at 20 oC to that of the mass of the same volume of water at 20 oC.


3. PRINCIPLE


The specific mass at 20 oC is determined by a hydrometer.


4. APPARATUS AND GLASSWARE


Usual laboratory equipment and, in particular:


4.1. Hydrometer


The specific gravity hydrometer is an instrument consisting of a glass float, which, at its lower end, is wide and heavy. There is a cylindrically shaped glass rod attached to the upper and of the float and coaxially orientated to it; the upper end of the rod is closed.


The glass float contains the load (lead, mercury, etc.) intended to adjust the hydrometer mass. The rod includes a graduated scale from 1,025 to 1,035 g/ml.


The hydrometer should he checked by the pycnometric method, using a pycnometer of a capacity of approximately 100 ml equipped with a precision thermometer.


4.2. Cylinders (glass or stainless steel).


Minimum dimensions should be:


- internal diameter approximately 35 mm


- internal height approximately 225 mm.


4.3. Water bath regulated at 200,1 oC.


4.4. Water bath regulated at 402 oC.


4.5. Thermometer, graduated to 0,5 oC.


5. PROCEDURE


5.1. Mix the sample by inversion to disperse the fat and place in the water bath (4.4.). Allow the sample to reach a temperature of 40 oC and maintain at that temperature for five minutes. Mix thoroughly by careful inversion to ensure that the fat is homogeneously distributed. Cool to 20 oC in the second water bath (4.3).


5.2. Mix the sample thoroughly by careful inversion to avoid inclusion of air. Pour the milk into the cylinder (4.2.), held inclined so as to avoid the formation of foam or of bubbles. Use sufficient milk sample to ensure that some will overflow from the cylinder when the hydrometer (4.1.) is placed in it. Carefully lower the hydrometer into the milk and allow to float freely when it reaches its balance position. The cylinder is to be placed vertical. The hydrometer must be positioned in the middle of the liquid column and should not touch the sides of the cylinder.


5.3. When the hydrometer reaches equilibrium read the graduation at the top of the meniscus.


5.4. Immediately after taking the hydrometer reading introduce the thermometer (4.5.) into the sample and read the temperature with an accuracy of 0,5 oC. The temperature must not differ more than 2 oC from 20 oC.


6. TEMPERATURE CORRECTION


6.1. If the temperature of the milk sample is not exactly 20 oC when the measurement of its specific mass is made, then the result obtained must be corrected adding to the determined specific mass 0,0002 for each degree Celcius above 20 oC, or subtracting 0,0002 for every degree Celsius below 20 oC. This correction is only valid if the temperature of the milk sample differs by not more than 5 oC from 20 oC.


7. EXPRESSION OF RESULTS


The method of calculation and formula specific mass of the sample is expressed in g/ml of skimmed milk at 20 oC according to the following formula:


1 000 7 mv


MG 7 mv


=


0,92 mv (1 000 MG)


1 000


MG 7 mv


0,92


920 MG 7 mv


where


mv = the specific mass of the sample read on the hydrometer (5.4) in g/l


MG = the fat content of the sample in g/l


0,92 = the density of fat.


8. PRECISION


8.1. Repeatability (r): 0,0003 g/ml.


8.2. Reproducibility (R): 0,0015 g/ml.

ALTERNATIVE PROCEDURE USING FAT-EXTRACTION TUBES WITH SIPHON OR WASH-BOTTLE FITTINGS


A.1. PROCEDURE


A.1.1. Preparation of the test sample


See 6.1.


A.1.2. Test portion


Proceed as specified in 6.2. but using the fat-extraction tubes (see 5.6.).


The test portion shall be delivered as completely as possible at the bottom of the extraction tube.


A.1.3. Blank test


See 6.3.


A.1.4. Preparation of fat-collecting vessel


See 6.4.


A.1.5. Determination


A.1.5.1. Add 2 ml of the ammonia solution (4.1.), or an equivalent volume of a more concentrated ammonia solution, and mix thoroughly with the pretreated test portion at the bottom of the tube. After the addition of the ammonia, carry out the determination without delay.


A.1.5.2. Add 10 ml of the ethanol (4.2.) and mix gently but thoroughly at the bottom of the tube. If desired, add two drops of the Congo red or Cresol red solution (4.3.).


A.1.5.3. Add 25 ml of diethyl ether (4.4.), close the tube with a cork saturated with water or with a stopper wetted with water (5.6.), and shake the tube vigorously, but not excessively (in order to avoid the formation of persistent emulsions), with repeated inversions for one minute. If necessary, cool the tube in running water, then carefully remove the cork or stopper and rinse it and the neck of the tube with a little of the mixed solvent (4.6.) using the wash bottle (5.8.) so that the rinsings run into the tube.


A.1.5.4. Add 25 ml of light petroleum (4.5.), close the tube with the rewetted cork or stopper (rewet by dipping in water), and shake the tube gently for 30 seconds as described in A.1.5.3.


A.1.5.5. Centrifuge the closed tube for one to five minutes at a rotational frequency of 500 to 600 rev min-1 (5.2.). If the centrifuge is not available (see note to 5.2.), allow the closed tube to stand in the rack (5.7.) for at least 30 minutes until the supernatant layer is clear and distincly separated from the aqueous layer. If necessary, cool the tube in running water.


A.1.5.6. Carefully remove the cork or stopper and rinse it and the neck of the tube with a little of the mixed solvent so that the rinsings run into the tube.


A.1.5.7. Insert a siphon fitting or a wash-bottle fitting into the tube and push down the long inner limb of the fitting until the inlet is approximately 3 mm above the interface between the layers. The inner limb of the fitting shall be parallel to the axis of the extraction tube.


Carefully transfer the supernatant layer out of the tube into the prepared fat-collecting vessel (6.4.) containing a few boiling aids (5.10.) in the case of flasks (optional with metal dishes), avoiding the transfer of any of the aqueous layer. Rinse the outlet of the fitting with a little of the mixed solvent, collecting the rinsings in the fat-collecting vessel.


A.1.5.8. Loosen the fitting from the neck of the tube, slightly raise the fitting and rinse the lower part of its long inner limb with a little of the mixed solvent. Lower and re-insert the fitting and transfer the rinsings to the fat-collecting vessel.


Rinse the outlet of the fitting with a little of the mixed solvent, collecting the rinsings in the vessel. If desired, the solvent or part of the solvent may be removed from the vessel by distillation or evaporation as described in 6.5.12.


A.1.5.9. Again loosen the fitting from the neck, slightly raise the fitting and add 5 ml of the ethanol to the contents of the tube, using the ethanol to rinse the long inner limb of the fitting; mix as described in A.1.5.2.


A.1.5.10. Carry out the second extraction by repeating the operations described in A.1.5.3. to A.1.5.8., but using only 15 ml of diethyl ether (4.4.) and 15 ml of light petroleum (4.5.). Use the ether to rinse the long inner limb of the fitting during the removal of the fitting from the tube after the previous extraction.


A.1.5.11. Carry out a third extraction by again repeating the operations described in A.1.5.3. to A.1.5.8. using 15 ml of the diethyl ether and 15 ml of the light petroleum and rinsing the long inner limb of the fitting as described in A.15.10.


The third extraction can be omitted for skimmed milk.


A.1.5.12. Proceed as described in 6.5.12. to 6.5.16.

Council Regulation (EEC) No 3508/92 of 27 November 1992 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes




COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3508/92 of 27 November 1992 establishing an integrated administration and control system for certain Community aid schemes


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas, pursuant to Article 8 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 729/70 of 21 April 1970 on the financing of the common agricultural policy (4), Member States must take the measures necessary to satisfy themselves that transactions financed by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) are actually carried out and are executed correctly, and prevent and deal with irregularities; whereas Article 23 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 4253/88 of 19 December 1988 laying down provisions for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 2052/88 as regards coordination of the activities of the different structural Funds between themselves and with the operations of the European Investment Bank and the other existing financial instruments (5) provides for the same obligation with regard to the agricultural structures policy;


Whereas up to now the various aid schemes have been administered and controlled by the Member States under separate rules for each scheme, as a result of their heterogeneous structure; whereas, however, in realigning the existing market measures a part of the reform of the common agricultural policy, the Community is opting, to a large extent, in both the crop and livestock sectors, for direct aid to producers;


Whereas, in order to adapt the administration and control mechanisms to the new situation and improve their effectiveness and usefulness, it is necessary to set up a new integrated administration and control system covering the aid schemes for arable crops, beef and veal, sheepmeat and goatmeat, as well as specific measures for farming in mountain, hill and certain less-favoured areas; whereas provision should be made for the possibility of including, at a later date, other aid schemes linked to the cultivated area;


Whereas, the various components of the integrated system will potentially result in more effective administration and control in the case of Community schemes not covered by this Regulation; whereas the Member States should therefore be authorized to avail themselves of the system on condition they do not in any way act in opposition to the provisions concerned;


Whereas, given the complexity of such a system and the large number of aid applications to be processed, it is essential to use the appropriate technical resources and administration and control methods; whereas as a result, the integrated system should comprise, in each Member State, a computerized data base, an alphanumeric identification system for agricultural parcels, aid applications from farmers, a harmonized control system and, in the livestock sector, a system for the identification and recording of animals;


Whereas the administration of the data collected and its use for the verification of aid applications make it necessary to set up high-performance computerized data bases allowing cross-checks in particular to be made;


Whereas the identification of agricultural parcels is a key element in the correct application of schemes linked to surface area; whereas experience has shown that the existing methods have certain deficiencies; whereas, therefore, provision should be made for an alphanumeric identification system set up initially, where necessary, with the aid of remote sensing;


Whereas in order to guarantee the possibility of effective control, 'area' aid applications must be submitted not later than during the first quarter of the year; whereas however the Member State may, in cases which it justifies, be authorized to apply a later date; whereas for 1993, having regard to the difficulties of implementing the integrated system, a later date is permitted;


Whereas, in the livestock sector, effective control requires that animals be identified and recorded; whereas, to this end, Council Directive 92/102/EEC of 27 November 1992, on the identification and registration of animals (6) lays down specific provisions in this respect; whereas recourse should therefore be had to that Directive;


Whereas the detailed rules governing aid applications continue to be subject to the provisions of each sector; whereas, however, for the sake of simplification, Member States should be authorized to make provision for the submission of one single application for several aid schemes;


Whereas one of the main advantages of the new system is the introduction of an integrated control system in each Member State avoiding any duplication of sectoral checks of the same type; whereas, as a result, the stepping up of checks made necessary by the reform of the common agricultural policy should be attainable without substantially increasing the number of checks; whereas aid applications submitted must be subjected to a thorough administrative check carried out with the aid of computerized data bases; whereas, up to now, administrative checks have been supplemented systematically by checks on the spot; whereas, to a large extent, on-the-spot checks on areas may be replaced by remote sensing;


Whereas the expenditure involved in introducing the integrated system may represent a high additional budgetary burden for Member States; whereas, consequently, provision should be made for part-financing for a certain period; whereas the diversity of existing production structures in the Member States must be taken into account; whereas, as a result, provision should be made for sharing out the financial contribution in a way which takes into account in particular the number of agricultural holdings, livestock numbers and the agricultural area in the Member States;


Whereas provision should be made for the gradual implementation of all the elements of the integrated system,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


1. Each Member State shall set up an integrated administration and control system, hereinafter referred to as the 'integrated system', applying:


(a) in the crop sector:


- the support system for producers of certain arable crops established by Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92 (7);


(b) in the livestock sector:


- to the premium arrangements for beef and veal producers established by Articles 4 (a) to (h) of Regulation (EEC) No 805/68 (8),


- to the premium arrangements for sheepmeat producers introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 3013/89 (9),


- to the specific measures for farming in mountain, hill and certain less-favoured areas introduced by Regulation (EEC) No 2328/91 (10) concerning compensatory allowances for cattle, sheep, goats and equidae,


hereinafter referred to as 'Community schemes'.


2. The Council may, acting by a qualified majority on a Commission proposal, extend the scope of the integrated system to other Community aid schemes.


3. For the purposes of applying Community aid schemes not covered by this Regulation and notwithstanding the specific provisions laid down under such schemes, in particular those concerning the terms under which aid may be granted, the Member States may incorporate in their administration and control mechanisms one or more of the administrative, technical or data-processing components of the integrated system.


Member States may extend this possibility to national schemes. They may use the information from the integrated system for statistical purposes.


Before availing themselves of these possibilities, Member States shall inform the Commission of their intentions in good time.


The Commission shall ensure that recourse to this possibility does not prejudice compliance with the provisions of the sectoral Regulations or of this Regulation.


4. Without prejudice to specific provisions provided for under the arrangements referred to in paragraph 1, for the purposes of this Regulation:


- farmer shall mean an individual agricultural producer, whether a natural or legal person or a group of natural or legal persons, whatever legal status is granted the group and its members by national law, whose holding is within Community territory,


- holding shall mean all the production units managed by a farmer situated within the same Member State's territory,


- agricultural parcel shall mean a continuous area of land on which a single crop is raised by a single farmer. In accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 12 the Commission shall adopt implementing arrangements for specific uses of agricultural parcels, in particular those concerning mixed crops and jointly used areas.


Article 2


The integrated system shall comprise the following elements:


(a) a computerized data base;


(b) an alphanumeric identification system for agricultural parcels;


(c) an alphanumeric system for the identification and registration of animals;


(d) aid applications;


(e) an integrated control system.


Article 3


1. The computerized data base shall record, for each agricultural holding, the data obtained from the aid applications. This data base shall in particular allow direct and immediate consultation, through the competent authority of the Member State, of the data relating at least to the previous three consecutive calendar and/or marketing years.


2. The Member States may set up decentralized data bases on condition that these, and the administrative procedures for recording and accessing data, are designed homogeneously throughout the territory of the Member State and are compatible with one another.


Article 4


The alphanumeric identification system for agricultural parcels shall be established on the basis of land registry maps and documents, other cartographic references or of aerial photographs or satellite pictures or other equivalent supporting references or on the basis of more than one of these elements.


Article 5


The system for the identification and registration of animals to be taken into account for the granting of aid governed by this Regulation shall be set up in accordance with Articles 4, 5, 6 and 8 of Directive 92/102/EEC.


Article 6


1. In order to be eligible under one or more Community schemes governed by this Regulation, each farmer shall submit, for each year, an 'area' aid application indicating:


- agricultural parcels, including areas under forage crops, and agricultural parcels covered by a set-aside measure for arable land and those laid fallow,


- where applicable, any other necessary information provided for either by the Regulations relating to the Community schemes, or by the Member State concerned.


2. The area aid application must be submitted by a date to be fixed by the Member State which shall be during the frist quarter of the year. However:


- in 1993, the Member State may fix a date not later than the dates referred to in Articles 10, 11 and 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92,


- in the following years, the Commission may, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 12, allow a Member State to fix a date between 1 April and the dates referred to in Articles 10, 11 and 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92, provided that the Member State can justify such a date, in particular by providing the Commission with a detailed working plan, which demonstrates that the requirements of the following subparagraph are fulfilled.


In all cases, the date shall be fixed bearing in mind, inter alia, the time required for all relevant data to be available for proper administrative and financial management of the aid and for the checks provided for in Article 8 to be carried out.


3. A Member State may decide that an 'area' aid application need contain only changes with respect to the 'area' aid application submitted for the previous year.


4. Certain amendments may be made to the 'area' aid application provided that they are received by the competent authorities, no later than the dates referred to in Articles 10, 11 and 12 of Regulation (EEC) No 1765/92.


5. The 'area' aid application, amended if necessary in accordance with paragraph 4, shall be deemed to be the aid application provided for in the scheme referred to in Article 1 (1) (a).


6. For each of the agricultural parcels declared, farmers shall indicate the area and its location which information must enable the parcel to be identified in the alphanumeric identification system for agricultural parcels.


7. Farmers applying only for aid under a scheme not directly linked to agricultural area may be exempted from the requirement to submit an 'area' aid application.


8. In order to be eligible for one of the Community schemes or arrangements referred to in Article 1 (1) (b), each farmer shall submit one or more 'animal' aid applications, at the latest by the dates set by the schemes concerned.


9. Where an aid application or amendments to it have to be accompanied by supplementary documentation, such documentation shall be considered part of the application.


10. While abiding by the dates or periods laid down for submitting applications under Community rules, the Member States may decide that a single application can cover:


- several 'animal' aid applications,


- an 'area' aid application and one or more 'animal' aid applications.


Article 7


The integrated control system shall cover all aid applications submitted, in particular as regards administrative checks, on-the-spot checks and, if appropriate, verification by aerial or satellite remote sensing.


Article 8


1. Member States shall carry out administrative checks on aid applications.


2. Administrative checks shall be supplemented by on-the-spot checks covering a sample of agricultural holdings. For all these checks, Member States shall draw up a sampling plan.


3. Each Member State shall designate an authority responsible for coordinating the checks provided for in this Regulation.


4. National authorities may, under conditions to be laid down, use remote sensing to determine the area of agricultural parcels, identify crops and verify their status.


5. Where the competent authorities of the Member State delegate some aspects of the work to be carried out pursuant to this Regulation to specialized agencies or firms, they must retain control over and responsibility for that work.


Article 9


The Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure protection of the data collected.


Article 10


1. The Community shall contribute to the expenditure incurred by Member States pursuant to this Regulation for the introduction of the computerized and checking structures and for the acquisition of aerial photographs or satellite pictures and the analysis thereof.


Expenditure on the updating of land registry maps shall not be co-financed by the Community.


2. The Community's financial contribution shall be granted for a period of three years from 1992, within the limits of the appropriations allocated for this purpose.


The total amount shall be shared among the Member States as follows:

Article 11


1. The Commission shall be informed at regular intervals of the progress of work on the implementation of the integrated system. It shall organize exchanges of views on this subject with the Member States.


2. After informing the competent authorities concerned in good time, Commission officials may carry out:


- any examination or control relating to the body of measures taken in order to establish the integrated system and to the eligibility of expenditure declared under the Community co-financing provided for in Article 10;


- checks at the specialized agencies and firms referred to in Article 8 (5).


Officials of the Member State concerned may take part in such checks.


The aforementioned powers to check shall not affect the application of national criminal law provisions which reserve certain acts for officials specifically designated by national law. Commission officials shall in particular not participate in home visits to or the formal interrogation of suspects under the criminal law of the Member State. They shall, however, have access to the information obtained thereby.


3. Without prejudice to the responsibilities of the Member States for the implementation and application of the integrated system, the Commission may seek the assistance of specialized bodies or persons in order to facilitate the establishment, monitoring and utilization of the integrated system, in particular with a view to providing the competent authorities of the Member States with technical advice, should they request it.

COUNCIL DECISION of 13 July 1992 on computerization of veterinary import procedures (Shift project), amending Directives 90/675/EEC, 91/496/EEC, 91/628/EEC and Decision 90/424/EEC, and repealing Decision 88/192/EEC (92/438/EEC)


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),


Whereas, since the adoption of Council Decision 88/192/EEC of 28 March 1988 on a system for health control of imports from third countries at frontier inspection posts (Shift project) (2), considerable progress has been made on harmonization in the veterinary field;


Whereas, in particular, the Council has adopted Directive 90/675/EEC of 10 December 1990 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on products entering the Community from third countries (3), Directive 91/496/EEC of 15 July 1991 laying down the principles governing the organization of veterinary checks on animals entering the Community from third countries (4) and Directive 91/628/EEC of 19 November 1991 on the protection of animals during transport (5);


Whereas, in the light of the favourable trend in harmonization in the veterinary sector, it is appropriate to lay down fresh provisions on computerization of veterinary import procedures and therefore to repeal Decision 88/192/EEC;


Whereas these fresh provisions must help protect public and animal health while permitting attainment of the internal market for animals and animal products;


Whereas these new provisions are all the more necessary in that inspection at internal frontiers is to be discontinued;


Whereas computerization of veterinary import procedures must provide an efficient way for an official veterinarian rejecting a consignment at a border inspection post to pass on relevant information and also data bases detailing import requirements and imports of animals and animal products;


Whereas Directives 90/675/EEC, 91/496/EEC and 91/628/EEC should be amended accordingly;


Whereas provision should be made in Council Decision 90/424/EEC of 26 June 1990 on expenditure in the veterinary field (6) for the Community to contribute financially to implementation of the new measures relating to the computerization of veterinary import procedures;


Whereas the Commission should be entrusted with the task of adopting the necessary implementing rules,

Council Regulation (EEC) No 443/92 of 25 February 1992 on financial and technical assistance to, and economic cooperation with, the developing countries in Asia and Latin America




COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 443/92 of 25 February 1992 on financial and technical assistance to, and economic cooperation with, the developing countries in Asia and Latin America


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof,


Having regard to the proposals from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Whereas the Community has been pursuing a policy of financial and technical cooperation with the Asian and Latin American (ALA) developing countries since 1976 and has, more recently, also embarked on economic cooperation with those countries; whereas these forms of cooperation are part of an overall policy of cooperation with the developing countries as a whole, which includes expansion of their trade by integration into the multilateral trading system, by appropriate measures to be taken within the relevant international organizations and by specific measures such as the Community system of generalized preferences;


Whereas the current process of European construction and the growing influence of the Community in the developing countries worldwide justify the continuation, with due regard for the complementary nature of Community action, of mutually advantageous economic cooperation with, and Community development aid to, the Asian and Latin American developing countries, the extension of cooperation to other countries or sectors in the two regions, increased financing for such policies and efforts to ensure that they are better adapted to national and local needs within each region;


Whereas the European Council has on a number of occasions confirmed the Community's political will to reinforce its cooperation with regions of the world where the level of development is still inadequate and to do so via an increased, coordinated and multi-faceted effort on the part of the Community and its Member States;


Whereas the European Council, meeting in Luxembourg on 28 and 29 June 1991, asked the Community and its Member States, through Community cooperation policy and by including clauses on human rights in economic and cooperation agreements with third countries, actively to promote human rights and the participation, without discrimination, of all individuals or groups in the life of society, bearing in mind particularly the role of women;


Whereas the European Parliament has examined the matter in detail on a number of occasions and has called for reinforced cooperation and for a revision of present legislation in order to ensure that aid is more efficient and more transparent;


Whereas, on 4 February 1991, the Council adopted final conclusions on guidelines for cooperation with the Asian and Latin American developing countries, covering in particular the priorities and sectors for consideration and the desirability of increasing the resources to be allocated to them and of enabling indicative medium-term programming for those resources to be undertaken;


Whereas both the European Parliament and the Council, while confirming traditional fields of action, have identified new priorities relating, in particular, to the environment, the human dimensio of development and the need for economic cooperation to take place in the mutual interest of the Community and its partner countries;


Whereas provision should be made for funding the aid referred to in this Regulation and other aid to the Asian and Latin American developing countries;


Whereas an amount of ECU 2 750 million is deemed necessary for the implementation of the aid covered by this Regulation and of other aid to the Asian and Latin American developing countries for an initial five-year period (1991-1995);


Whereas the amount deemed necessary for the funding period 1991-1992, under the present financial perspective, is ECU 1 069,8 million;


Whereas the amounts to be committed for funding the aid during the period 1993 to 1995 should be included in the existing Community financial framework and whereas the Asian and Latin American developing countries should be given the same priority in the budget for 1993 to 1995 as they were in the period 1991 to 1992;


Whereas the volume of Community aid for the period after 1995 should be determined in accordance with existing procedures;


Whereas the rules governing the administration of financial and technical assistance to, and economic cooperation with, the Asian and Latin American developing countries should be established;


Whereas it is necessary to repeal Council Regulation (EEC) No 442/81 of 17 February 1981 on financial and technical aid to non-associated developing countries (3);


Whereas the Treaty does not provide specific powers of action for the adoption of this Regulation, other than those contained in Article 235,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


The Community shall continue and broaden Community cooperation with the Asian and Latin American developing countries, hereinafter referred to as 'the ALA developing countries', which are not signatories to the Lom Convention and do not benefit from the Community's cooperation policy with Mediterranean third countries. This cooperation, which shall be in addition to assistance from the Member States, shall involve financial and technical development assistance and economic cooperation. In this connection, the Community shall attach the utmost importance to the promotion of human rights, support for the process of democratization, good governance, environmental protection, trade liberalization and strengthening the cultural dimension, by means of an increasing dialogue on political, economic and social issues conducted in the mutual interest.


Article 2


The aim of Community development and cooperation policies shall be human development.


Aware that respect for, and the exercise of, human rights and fundamental freedoms and democratic principles are preconditions for real and lasting economic and social development, the Community shall give increased support to the countries most committed to those principles, particularly for positive initiatives to put them into practice.


In the case of fundamental and presistent violations of human rights and democratic principles, the Community could amend or even suspend the implementation of cooperation with the States concerned by confining cooperation to activities of direct benefit to those sections of the population in need.


Article 3


All ALA developing countries shall be eligible for financial and technical assistance and economic cooperation. The recipients of aid and partners in cooperation may include not only States and regions but decentralized authorities, regional organizations, public agencies, local or traditional communities, private institutes and operators, including cooperatives and non-governmental organizations. The needs and priorities of each country and each region shall be taken into account when granting the aid covered by this Regulation. Financial and technical assistance


Article 4


Financial and technical assistance shall be targeted primarily on the poorest sections of the population and the poorest countries in the two regions, through the implementation of programmes and projects in whatever sectors Community aid is likely to play an important role. In particular, measures shall be implemented in areas where domestic, economic and human resources are difficult to mobilize, but which are of strategic importance either for the development of the countries concerned or for the international community as a whole.


Article 5


Financial and technical assistance shall give priority to developing the rural sector and improving the level of food security. In this regard, integrating food aid into other development instruments may help this form of aid to fulfil its specific role and objectives. Community support for the rural sector must also include measures in small towns serving rural areas, in order to promote employment. The improvement of the economic, legal and social environment for the private sector, including small and medium-sized undertakings, must also be taken into account.


Protection of the environment and natural resources, and sustainable development, shall be long-term priorities. 10 %, being the weighted average of the necessary financial resources of the aid, for the period 1991 to 1995, shall be set aside for projects specifically aimed at protecting the environment, in particular tropical forests.


Furthermore, consideration shall be given in all operations to protecting the environment and natural resources.


Special attention must be given to measures to combat drugs. Community cooperation with the ALA developing countries to promote the fight against drugs shall be stepped up on the basis of a dialogue within the more general context of the economic development of the producer countries and their cooperation with the European Community. This cooperation shall cover measures involving both humanitarian and development aid.


The human dimension of development shall be present in all areas of action, given the objective of this form of cooperation.


The cultural dimension of development must remain a constant objective in all activities and programmes with which the Community is associated.


Aid should accordingly be allocated, inter alia, to specific projects for the spread of democracy, good governance and human rights.


Furthermore, care should be taken to ensure not only that the changes brought in by the projects and programmes do not have any detrimental effects on the position and role of women, but that, on the contrary, specific measures, or even projects, are adopted in order to increase their active participation, on an equal footing, in the productive process and its results, and in social activities and decision making.


Special attention shall also be given to child protection.


Ethnic minorities warrant special attention through measures designed to improve their living conditions while respecting their cultural identity.


Special attention shall be given to demographic questions, in particular those relating to population growth.


Community aid for development projects and programmes must take account of macro-economic and sectoral problems and favour operations which have an effect on the structural make-up of the economy, on the development of sectoral policies and on the development of institutions. In order to increase their effectiveness and obtain greater synergy, dialogue and cooperation with the relevant international institutions and bilateral financiers should be sought.


Support for the national institutions of the developing countries, so as to strengthen their capacity to manage development policies and projects, represents an area of action likely to assume a strategic role in the development process.


Maintaining a suitable dialogue between the developing countries and the Community is an important element in this context.


Regional cooperation between developing countries shall be considered a priority area for financial and technical assistance, particularly in the following fields:


- cooperation on the environment,


- the development of intra-regional trade,


- the strengthening of regional institutions,


- support for regional integration and the establishment of joint policies and activities among developing countries,


- regional communications, particularly as regards standards, networks and services, including telecommunications,


- research,


- training,


- rural development and food security,


- cooperation in the sphere of energy.


Part of the aid may be used for rehabilitation and reconstruction following disasters of all kinds and for disaster-prevention measures.


Article 6


Financial and technical assistance, shall be extended to the relatively more advanced ALA developing countries, in particular in the following specific fields and cases:


- the spread of democracy and human rights,


- prevention of natural disasters and reconstruction in their wake,


- the fight against drugs,


- the environment and natural resources,


- strengthening institutions, especially public authorities,


- pilot schemes to help particularly under privileged strata of the population especially in large conurbations,


- regional cooperation and integration, with special attention being paid to regional cooperation and integration schemes allowing partnerships to be formed between poor and relatively advanced countries. Economic cooperation


Article 7


Economic cooperation, devised to serve the mutual interests of the Community and its partner countries, shall contribute to the development of the ALA developing countries by helping them build up their institutional capacity so as to create an environment more favourable to investment and development and make the most of the prospects opened up by the growth of international trade, including the European single market, and by enhancing the role of businessmen, technology and know-how from all the Member States, particularly in the private sector and in small and medium-sized undertakings.


Economic cooperation shall be aimed in particular at establishing a climate of confidence by supporting countries which pursue macro-economic and structural policies that are open to trade and investment and conducive to technology transfer, in particular by protecting intellectual property rights.


Article 8


Economic cooperation shall include three sectors:


1. Improvement of scientific and technological potential and of the economic, social and cultural environment in general by means of training schemes and the transfer or know-how. Scientific and technological cooperation, including such cooperation in the field of high technology programmes, may derive benefit also from the implementation of the multiannual framework research programme and from the provisions of Article 130N of the Treaty. Economic cooperation shall be directed chiefly at executives, economic decision-makers and instructors and shall cover all economic, technical and scientific fields, in particular energy, industrial and urban ecology and services technology. It should promote links between institutes and research centres on both sides and take account of their capacity for the rapid acquisition of know-how and modern technology which can then be disseminated in the recipient country;


2. Improvement of the institutional structure, which must go hand in hand with a closer dialogue with partners, in order to make the economic, legislative, administrative and social climate more conducive to development;


3. Support for undertakings, for example by means of trade promotion, training and technical assistance schemes, by establishing contacts between undertakings and by schemes to facilitate cooperation between them.


Regional cooperation must be regarded as an important sector for economic cooperation, in particular with respect to:


- cooperation on industrial ecology,


- intra-regional trade,


- regional institutions for economic integration,


- regional policies,


- communications, including telecommunications,


- research and training,


- cooperation in the sphere of energy,


- industrial cooperation. Implementing procedures


Article 9


Financial and technical assistance and expenditure on economic cooperation shall be provided mainly in the form of grants financed from the general budget of the European Communities.


Wherever possible, indicative five-year programming shall be established for each objective, country or, if appropriate, region.


Co-financing with the Member States or other donors shall be sought through greater coordination. The Community nature of the aid must be maintained.


Article 10


1. Community funding of the aid referred to in Article 9 shall cover an initial five-year period (1991-1995).


2. The amount of Community funding deemed necessary for the implementation of the aid shall be ECU 2 750 million, 10 % of which shall be allocated to the environment, especially the protection of tropical forests. An amount of ECU 1 069,8 million shall be earmarked for the period 1991-1992 under the financial perspective for 1988-1992.


For the period 1993-1995, the amount shall be included in the Community financial framework then in force.


3. The budget authority shall determine the appropriations available for each financial year, account being taken of the principles of sound financial management referred to in Article 2 of the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities.


4. For the subsequent period covered by this Regulation, the amount of aid shall be determined in accordance with the procedures then in force.


Article 11


Financial and technical assistance may cover all foreign currency costs and local costs for carrying out projects and programmes, including, whenever necessary, integrated programmes and sectoral projects.


Maintenance and operating expenses for economic cooperation operations, training and research programmes and development projects and programmes may, in particular, be covered. However, except for training and research programmes, such expenses may be covered only at the launching stage and in gradually decreasing amounts.


Systematic efforts must be made to seek contributions, particularly in financial form, from partners (countries, local communities, undertakings, individual recipients) within the limits of their possibilities and according to the nature of each operation.


The payment of taxes, duties and charges, and the purchase of land, shall be excluded from Community financing.


Study costs and the short- and long-term use of experts to assist the recipients and the Commission in devising general policies, identifying and preparing operations and monitoring and evaluating them shall normally be covered by Community funds, either as part of the financing for individual operations or separately.

92/260/EEC: Commission Decision of 10 April 1992 on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for temporary admission of registered horses




COMMISSION DECISION of 10 April 1992 on animal health conditions and veterinary certification for temporary admission of registered horses (92/260/EEC)


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Directive 90/426/EEC of 26 June 1990 on animal health conditions governing the movement and import from third countries of equidae (1), as last amended by Commission Decision 92/130/EEC (2), in particular Articles 15 (a) and 16 thereof,


Whereas by Council Decision 79/542/EEC (3), as last amended by Commission Decision 92/162/EEC (4), the list of third countries from which the Member States authorize imports of equidae in particular has been established;


Whereas it is also necessary to take into account the regionalization of certain third countries, which is the subject of Commission Decision 92/160/EEC (5), as amended by Decision 92/161/EEC (6);


Whereas the existence of equivalent health situations between certain third countries justifies establishing several health zones for the importation of equidae;


Whereas the different categories of horses have their own features and their imports are authorized for different purposes; whereas, consequently, specific health requirements must be established for temporary admissions of registered horses;


Whereas, given the existence of different health situations, it is necessary to establish several health certificates for temporary admission of registered horses;


Whereas this Decision should be re-examined before 31 December 1992;


Whereas the measures provided for in this Decision are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:


Article 1


Without prejudice to Decision 92/160/EEC, Member States shall authorize the temporary admission of registered horses:


- coming from third countries appearing in Annex I,


- conforming to the requirements laid down in one of the specimen animal health certificates in Annex II.


Article 2


This Decision is addressed to the Member States.

Council Regulation (EEC) No 2077/92 of 30 June 1992 concerning inter-branch organizations and agreements in the tobacco sector




COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2077/92 of 30 June 1992 concerning inter-branch organizations and agreements in the tobacco sector


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 42 and 43 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas the medium and long-term prospects for the Community and world agricultural markets require certain instruments of the common agricultural policy to be revised in order to restore market balance; whereas such adjustments, directed principally at increasing the flexibility of the market-support instruments, require the operators concerned to change their economic behaviour to take better account of the actual market situation;


Whereas inter-branch organizations established by individuals or groups, and representing a significant proportion of the various categories involved in production, processing and marketing in the tobacco sector are likely to contribute to better account being taken of the market situation and encourage changes in economic behaviour intended to improve knowledge and organization of production, processing and marketing; whereas some of their activities may contribute to improving market balance and so help achieve the objectives in Article 39 of the Treaty; whereas the measures which may constitute such a contribution by the inter-branch organizations should be defined;


Whereas in view of the above, it appears appropriate to grant specific recognition to bodies which can demonstrate their proven representativeness at regional, inter-regional or Community level and which take positive action in pursuit of the objectives mentioned above; whereas such recognition should be granted by the Member State or by the Commission depending on the scope of the activities of the trade association;


Whereas to support certain activities of inter-branch organizations which are of particular interest in the light of the current rules concerning the market organization for the tobacco sector, provision should be made for the rules adopted by an inter-branch organization for its members to be extended, subject to certain conditions, to all non-member producers and groups in one or more regions; whereas non-members should also be made liable to pay all or part of the subscriptions intended to cover the non-administrative costs incurred in pursuing such activities; whereas this procedure should be implemented in a way which guarantees the rights of the socio-economic groups concerned, in particular the rights of the consumer;


Whereas other activities of the recognized inter-branch organizations may be of general economic or technical interest for the tobacco sector and so be of benefit to all persons active in the branches in question, whether or not they are members of the organization; whereas in such cases it appears reasonable to make non-members liable to pay the subscriptions intended to cover the costs, other than administrative costs, arising directly from performance of the activities in question;


Whereas, in order to ensure correct operation of the scheme, there should be close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, which should also have permanent monitoring powers, particularly as regards recognition of inter-branch organizations operating at regional or inter-regional level and the agreements and concerted practices adopted by such organizations;


Whereas there should be provision for publication, at the beginning of each year, of a list of the organizations recognized during the previous year, a list of the organizations whose recognition has been withdrawn during the same period and the rules which have been extended with an indication of their scope, for the information of the Member States and other interested parties,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


This Regulation lays down the conditions for the recognition and activity of inter-branch organizations operating in the sector covered by the market organization for tobacco.


Article 2


Inter-branch organizations which:


1. comprise representatives of the economic activities relating to production of, processing of and trade in tobacco;


2. have been set up on the initiative of all or some of their constituent organizations or associations;


3. are pursuing a number of the following activities at regional level, in a number of Community regions or throughout the Community; taking account where appropriate of consumer interests:


(a) contributing to enhanced coordination of the placing on the market of leaf or baled tobacco;


(b) preparing standard contracts compatible with Community rules;


(c) improving market intelligence and transparency;


(d) increasing value added, particularly by means of marketing and research into new uses which do not pose a threat to public health;


(e) redirecting the sector towards products which better meet market and public health requirements;


(f) carrying out research into methods permitting reduced use of plant health products and guaranteeing product quality and soil conservation;


(g) developing methods and instruments for improving product quality at the production and processing stages;


(h) use of certified seed and monitoring of product quality;


shall be recognized under this Regulation.


Article 3


1. On application, Member States shall recognize inter-branch organizations established in their territory which:


(a) carry out their activities at regional or inter-regional level within the territory;


(b) cover a significant proportion of the production and/or trade in relation to the sphere of action and the branches represented; where an inter-branch organization is inter-regional in scope, it must provide proof of minimum representativeness, in respect of each of the grouped branches, in each region covered;


(c) pursue a number of the activities referred to in Article 2 (3);


(d) do not themselves undertake the production, processing or marketing of the products covered by the market organization referred to in Article 1.


2. Prior to recognition being granted, Member States shall notify the Commission of the inter-branch organizations which have applied for recognition and provide all necessary information on the branches of economic activity which they encompass, their representativeness, the activities undertaken and any other information required for consideration of the application.


The Commission may oppose recognition within 60 days of notification by the Member State.


3. Member States shall withdraw recognition:


(a) if the conditions laid down in this Regulation cease to be met;


(b) if the inter-branch organization contravenes one or more of the prohibitions listed in Article 7 (3), without prejudice to criminal proceedings which may be brought under national law;


(c) if the inter-branch organization fails in its obligation to make the notification required under Article 7 (2).


Member States shall notify the Commission immediately of decisions to withdraw recognition.


Article 4


1. On application the Commission shall recognize inter-branch organizations which:


(a) carry out their activities throughout or in part of the territories of several Member States, or throughout the Community;


(b) have been established under the national legislation of a Member State or under Community law;


(c) satisfy the provisions of Article 3 (1) (b), (c) and (d).


2. The Commission shall notify applications for recognition to the Member States on whose territories the inter-branch organization is established and in which it carries out its activities. Following such notification, the Member States concerned shall have two months within which to make their comments.


The Commission shall take a decision on recognition within three months of receiving the application and all necessary information.


3. The Commission shall withdraw recognition of the organizations referred to in paragraph 1 in the circumstances referred to in Article 3 (3).


Article 5


The Commission shall publish in the 'C' series of the Official Journal of the European Communities the names of the inter-branch organizations recognized, together with a statement of the economic sector or the area in which they operate and the activities pursued within the meaning of Article 2. Withdrawals of recognition shall also be published.


Article 6


Recognition of inter-branch organizations shall imply authorization for them to carry out the activities referred to in Article 2 (3) subject to the conditions laid down in this Regulation.


Article 7


1. Notwithstanding Article 1 of Regulation No 26 (4), Article 85 (1) of the Treaty shall not apply to the agreements and concerted practices of recognized inter-branch organizations intended to implement the measures referred to in Article 2 (3).


2. Paragraph 1 shall apply only provided that:


- the agreements and concerted practices have been notified to the Commission, and that


- within three months of receipt of all the details required the Commission has not found that the agreements or concerted practices are incompatible with Community rules.


The agreements and concerted practices may not be implemented until this period has elapsed.


3. Agreements and concerted practices which:


- may lead to the partitioning of markets in any form within the Community,


- may affect the sound operation of the market organization,


- may create distortions of competition which are not essential in achieving the objectives of the common agricultural policy pursued by the inter-branch organization measure,


- entail the fixing of prices or quotas, without prejudice to measures taken by inter-branch organizations in the application of specific provisions of Community rules,


- may create discrimination or eliminate competition in respect of a substantial proportion of the products in question,


shall in any case be declared contrary to Community rules.


4. If, following expiry of the three-month period referred to in the second indent of paragraph 2, the Commission finds that the conditions for applying this Regulation have not been met, it shall take a decision declaring that Article 85 (1) of the Treaty applies to the agreement or concerted practice in question.


That decision shall not come into effect earlier than the date of notification to the inter-branch organization concerned, unless that inter-branch organization has given incorrect information or abused the exemption provided for in paragraph 1.


Article 8


1. Inter-branch organizations may request that certain of their agreements or concerted practices be made binding for a limited period on individuals and groups in the economic sector concerned which are not members of the trade branches which they represent, in the areas in which the branches operate.


In order for their rules to be extended, inter-branch organizations must represent at least two thirds of the production and/or the trade concerned. Where the proposed extension of the rules is of inter-regional scope, the inter-branch organizations must prove they possess a minimum degree of representativeness, in respect of each of the grouped branches, in each region covered.


2. The rules, of which extension of the scope is requested, shall have been in force for at least one year and shall relate to one of the following objectives:


(a) knowledge of production and the market;


(b) definition of minimum quantities;


(c) the utilization of cultivation methods compatible with the protection of the environment;


(d) the definition of minimum standards of packing and presentation;


(e) use of certified seed and monitoring of product quality.


3. Extension of the rules shall be subject to approval by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 9.


Article 9


1. In the case of rules laid down by inter-branch organizations recognized by the Member States, the Member States shall publish for the information of the socio-economic groups concerned the agreements or concerted practices which it is intended to extend to non-member individual operators or groups in a particular region or group of regions.


Those concerned shall have two months in which to make their comments.


2. At the end of this period and prior to taking a decision, the Member States shall notify the Commission of the rules which they intend to make binding and supply all appropriate information. Notification shall include all the comments received following publication in accordance with paragraph 1 and an evaluation of the application for extension.


3. The Commission shall publish in the 'C' series of the Official Journal of the European Communities rules of which extension is requested by inter-branch organizations which it has recognized under Article 4. Following publication, the Member States and the socio-economic groups concerned shall have two months in which to make their comments.


4. If the rules of which extension is requested are 'technical rules' within the meaning of Directive 83/189/EEC (5), they shall be notified to the Commission in accordance with Article 8 of that Directive at the same time as the notification provided for in paragraph 2.


Without prejudice to paragraph 5, where the conditions for delivery of a reasoned opinion under Article 9 of that Directive are met, the Commission shall refuse to approve the rules of which extension has been requested.


5. The Commission shall take a decision within three months of notification by the Member State in accordance with paragraph 2 and, where paragraph 3 applies, within five months of publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities of the application for extension of rules.


The Commission shall in any case take a negative decision if it finds that the extension:


- prevents competition in a substantial part of the common market,


- restricts freedom of trade, or


- jeopardizes the objectives of the common agricultural policy or those of any other Community rules.


6. The rules, application of which has been extended, shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.


7. When, pursuant to this Article, rules are made binding on non-members of an inter-branch organization, the Member State or the Commission, as appropriate, may decide that individuals or groups which are not members shall pay the organization all or part of the subscriptions paid by members, to the extent that such subscriptions are not used to cover the administrative costs of applying the rules or concerted practices.


Article 10


1. Where one or more of the activities referred to in paragraph 2 are pursued by a recognized inter-branch organization and are in the general economic interest of those persons whose activities relate to one or more of the products, the Member State which has granted recognition, or the Commission, where recognition has been granted under Article 4, may decide that individuals or groups which are not members of the association but which benefit from those activities shall pay the organization all or part of the subscriptions paid by its members to the extent that such subscriptions are intended to cover costs, other than administrative costs of any description, directly incurred as a result of pursuing the activities in question.


2. The activities referred to in this Article shall relate to one or other of the following objectives:


- research to add value to the products, in particular through new uses which do not pose a threat to public health,


- studies to improve the quality of leaf or baled tobacco,


- research into methods of cultivation permitting reduced use of plant health products and guaranteeing conservation of the soil and the environment.


3. The Member States concerned shall notify the Commission of decisions which they intend to take under paragraph 1. Such decisions may not take effect until three months have elapsed from the date of notification to the Commission. The Commission may within this time limit call for the rejection of all or part of the draft decision if the general economic interest put forward does not appear to be well founded.


4. Where the activities of an inter-branch organization recognized by the Commission pursuant to Article 4 are in the general economic interest, the Commission shall notify its draft decision to the Member States concerned, who shall then have two months in which to make their comments.


Article 11


Any measure by the Member States or the Commission imposing a subscription on individuals or groups which are not members of an inter-branch organization shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The measure may not take effect until two months have elapsed from the date of publication.


Article 12


Detailed rules for the application of this Regulation shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 23 of Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 (6).


This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

Council Regulation (EEC) No 3911/92 of 9 December 1992 on the export of cultural goods




COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) N 3911/92 of 9 December 1992 on the export of cultural goods


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas, in view of the completion of the internal market, rules on trade with third countries are needed for the protection of cultural goods;


Whereas, in the light of the conclusions of the Council meeting on 19 November 1990, it seems necessary to take measures in particular to ensure that exports of cultural goods are subject to uniform controls at the Community's external borders;


Whereas such a system should require the presentation of a licence issued by the competent Member State prior to the export of cultural goods covered by this Regulation; whereas this necessitates a clear definition of the scope of such measures and the procedures for their implementation; whereas the implementation of the system should be as simple and efficient as possible; whereas a Committee should be set up to assist the Commission in carrying out the responsibilities conferred on it by this Regulation;


Whereas, in view of the considerable experience of the Member States' authorities in the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1468/81 of 19 May 1981 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs or agricultural matters (4), the said Regulation should be applied to this matter;


Whereas the Annex to this Regulation is aimed at making clear the categories of cultural goods which should be given particular protection in trade with third countries, but is not intended to prejudice the definition, by Member States, of national treasures within the meaning of Article 36 of the Treaty,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


Without prejudice to Member States' powers under Article 36 of the Treaty, the term 'cultural goods` shall refer, for the purposes of this Regulation, to the items listed in the Annex.


TITLE 1


Export licence


Article 2


1. The export of cultural goods outside the customs territory of the Community shall be subject to the presentation of an export licence.


2. The export licence shall be issued at the request of the person concerned:


- by a competent authority of the Member State in whose territory the cultural object in question was lawfully and definitively located on 1 January 1993,

Council Directive 92/97/EEC of 10 November 1992 amending Directive 70/157/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles




COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/97/ EEC of 10 November 1992 amending Directive 70/157/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas measures should be adopted with the aim of progressively establishing the internal market over a period expiring on 31 December 1992; whereas the internal market will comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital will be ensured;


Whereas the European Parliament has already called on the Commission to submit a proposal in 1992 laying down the maximum permissible noise limits taking account of the noise disturbance thresholds defined by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD);


Whereas Council Directive 70/157/EEC (4) lays down limit values for the sound level of motor vehicles; whereas these limit values were reduced for the first time by Directive 77/212/EEC (5) and for the second time by Directive 84/424/EEC (6); whereas these reductions were particularly severe in the case of motor buses, motor coaches and lorries, amounting to approximately 10 decibels (dB (A));


Whereas Council Directive 70/157/EEC is one of the separate directives of the EEC type-approval procedure established by Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers (7);


Whereas the Council, in adopting Directive 84/424/EEC amending Directive 70/157/EEC, decided that the provisions of the Directive would later be reviewed on a proposal from the Commission; whereas the proposal from the Commission was based on studies and research concerning possible further legislative measures taking account simultaneously of all the main aspects of Community rules in the motor-vehicle sector, in particular those relating to safety, environmental protection and energy conservation;


Whereas the protection of the public against noise pollution requires additional suitable measures to reduce still further the sound level of motor vehicles; whereas such measures must take account of the technological advances to be applied; whereas enough time must consequently be allowed for their implementation after adoption of this Directive so that the technological advances, at present at the prototype stage, can be applied to series production; whereas the limit values currently applicable to heavy goods vehicles took effect only from 1 October 1989;


Whereas achievement of a significant and effective reduction of such nuisances will require that the differences between the measuring techniques in current use and the actual traffic conditions be reduced to the maximum extent possible; whereas certain types of technology cannot yet be verified and are not yet comparable with those used hitherto in the type-approval procedures for motor vehicles;


Whereas the current measuring conditions, and in particular the definition of the surface of the test track and certain ambient conditions during the tests, such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed and background noise require more detailed description; whereas those closer details will be provided as soon as possible by means of the procedure referred to in Article 13 of Directive 70/156/EEC;


Whereas, of the noise pollution emanating from vehicles, that caused by the tyres has proved to be particularly severe when the vehicles' speed exceeds 60 km/h; whereas protecting the public effectively against noise pollution, particularly that caused by traffic in urban areas, requires that two further stages be completed; whereas the first stage, covered by this Directive, consists in giving as much additional weight as possible to the current requirements for each category of vehicle with respect to the sound levels of the mechanical parts and exhaust systems of motor vehicles; whereas the second stage - in the light of further, more detailed studies and research on the problems associated with, and the technical solutions for noise created by, the contact between tyres and the road surface - will result in the establishment of realistic and reproducible criteria and methods for determining this important type of noise pollution and for laying down the corresponding requirements to be complied with;


Whereas completion of the first stage requires that Annex I to Directive 70/157/EEC be amended by reducing the sound-level values expressed in dB (A) for each category of vehicle referred to in the said Annex and by improving the test method for high-powered vehicles; whereas this type of vehicle is increasingly being designed so as to produce a higher ratio between engine power and vehicle mass and the curve representing the torque as a function of engine speed has been modified to produce greater motive force at low engine speed; whereas these new designs consequently give rise to greater use of gear ratios in urban traffic and have a major influence on the noise emitted by the mechanical parts as compared with road noise; whereas account has been taken of these new designs by modifying the measuring technique for this type of vehicle, due allowance having been made for the speed of approach to the acceleration section where the sound level is to be measured;


Whereas, given the many different types of tyre and road surface which exist and which correspond to the different geographical and atmospheric conditions, it is necessary to continue studies and research so as to be able to establish criteria to be met by tyres and to define a numerical value for the type-approval of motor vehicles; whereas the results of such studies and research will permit the introduction, at a second stage, of further requirements, in addition to measures covering noise of mechanical source;


Whereas the control of sound emissions produced by the interaction between tyres and roadway must be based not only on tyres but also on the composition of the asphalt (noise-absorbing asphalt); whereas it is necessary to continue studies and research so as to be able to ascertain numerical indices in order to establish objective criteria for road conformity;


Whereas Member States should be allowed to advance the authorization for introduction of vehicles which satisfy the Community standards by means of tax incentives; whereas this implies that the Council should, by 1 October 1995, adopt the requirements for the second stage, for which the Commission will present a proposal by 31 March 1994;


Whereas, to enable the European environment to obtain maximum benefit from these provisions while at the same time ensuring the unity of the market, it is necessary to lay down stricter European standards based on total harmonization,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


Article 1


The Annexes to Directive 70/157/EEC are hereby replaced by the Annexes to this Directive.


Article 2


1. With effect from 1 July 1993, Member States may not, on grounds relating to the permissible sound level and the exhaust system:


- refuse, in respect of a type of motor vehicle, to grant EEC type-approval, to issue the document referred to in the last indent of Article 10 (1) of Directive 70/156/EEC, or to grant national type-approval,


or


- prohibit the initial entry into service of vehicles,


if the sound level and the exhaust system of this type of vehicle or of these vehicles comply with the requirements of Directive 70/157/EEC as amended by this Directive.


2. With effect from 1 October 1995, Member States:


- may no longer grant EEC type-approval or issue the document referred to in the last indent of Article 10 (1) of Directive 70/156/EEC in respect of a type of motor vehicle,


- must refuse to grant national type-approval in respect of a type of motor vehicle,


of which the sound level and the exhaust system do not comply with the requirements set out in the Annexes to Directive 70/157/EEC as amended by this Directive.


3. With effect from 1 October 1996, Member States shall prohibit the initial entry into service of motor vehicles of which the sound level and the exhaust systems do not comply with the requirements set out in the Annexes to Directive 70/157/EEC as amended by this Directive.


Article 3


Member States may make provision for tax incentives only in respect of motor vehicles which comply with this Directive. Such incentives must comply with the provisions of the Treaty and, in addition, must meet the following conditions:


- they must apply to all nationally-manufactured motor vehicles and all imported vehicles which are offered for sale on the market of a Member State and which meet, in advance, the requirements of this Directive due to be complied with in 1995,


- they shall be terminated with effect from the mandatory application of the sound level values laid down in Article 2 (3) for new motor vehicles,


- in respect of each type of motor vehicle, they must represent an amount substantially below the additional cost of the technical solutions introduced to ensure compliance with the established values and of their installation on the vehicle.


The Commission must be informed in good time of plans to institute or change tax incentives as referred to in the first subparagraph. The Commission must give its consent before such incentives are put into effect and must, in particular, take into account the impact of such incentives on the internal market.


Article 4


1. Specific details on the conditions of measurement shall be supplied as soon as possible via the procedure referred to in Article 13 of Directive 70/156/EEC.


2. Subsequent measures intended, in particular, to reconcile safety requirements with the need to limit the noise arising from contact between tyres and the road surface shall be decided upon before 1 October 1995 by the Council acting by a qualified majority on the basis of a proposal from the Commission, which shall take account of the studies and research to be performed on this source of noise, and shall be presented by 31 March 1994.


3. Member States shall take the necessary measures to have the type-approval sound level values published in such a way as to make them widely accessible, before 1 October 1994. They shall inform the Commission before this date of the steps taken to comply with this requirement.


Article 5


Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive before 1 July 1993. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.


When Member States adopt these provisions, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such a reference shall be laid down by the Member States.


Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field governed by this Directive.


Article 6


This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

Measurements must be carried out using the 'fast' response of the sound-level meter and the 'A' weighting curve which are also described in that publication.


At the beginning and end of each set of measurements, the sound-level meter must be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions by means of an appropriate sound source (e.g. a pistonphone). The test must be considered invalid if the sound-level meter errors registered during this calibration exceed 1 dB.


5.2.2.2.2.Speed measurements


The engine speed and vehicle speed on the test section shall be determined with an accuracy of 3 % or better.


5.2.2.3.Conditions of measurement


5.2.2.3.1.Test site


The test site must consist of a central acceleration section surrounded by a substantially flat test area. The test acceleration section must be level; the track surface must be dry and such that rolling noise remains low.


The test track must be such that the conditions of a free sound field between the sound source and the microphone are attained to within 1 dB. These conditions shall be deemed to be met if there are no large sound-reflecting objects such as fences, rocks, bridges or buildings within 50 m of the centre of the acceleration section. The test-track surface must comply with the specifications in Annex VI.


There must be no obstacle which could affect the sound field within the vicinity of the microphone and no persons shall stand between the microphone and the sound source. The observer carrying out the measurements must so position himself as not to affect the readings of the measuring instrument.


5.2.2.3.2.Meteorological conditions


Measurements must not be made in poor atmospheric conditions. It must be ensured that the results are not affected by gusts of wind.


5.2.2.3.3.Ambient noise


For measurements, the A-weighted sound level of sound sources other than those of the vehicle to be tested and of wind effects must be at least 10 dB (A) below the sound level produced by the vehicle. A suitable windscreen may be fitted to the microphone provided that account is taken of its effect on the sensitivity and directional characteristics of the microphone.


5.2.2.3.4.Condition of vehicle


For these measurements, the vehicle must be in running order as defined in item 2.6 of Annex I to Directive 70/156/EEC and, except in the case of vehicles which cannot be uncoupled, without trailer or semi-trailer.


The vehicle's tyres must be of the type normally fitted to such vehicles by the manufacturer and must be inflated to the appropriate pressure(s) for the unladen vehicle.


Before the measurements are made, the engine must be brought to its normal operating condition as regards temperatures, settings, fuel, spark plugs, carburettor(s), etc. (as appropriate). If the vehicle is fitted with fan(s) having an automatic actuating mechanism, this system must not be interfered with during the measurements.


Only the normal highway drive must be engaged in vehicles with more than two drive wheels.


5.2.2.4.Method of measurement


5.2.2.4.1.Nature and number of measurements


The maximum sound level expressed in A-weighted decibels (dB (A)) shall be measured as the vehicle is driven between lines AA%amp% prime; and BB%amp% prime; (Figure 1). The measurement shall be invalid if an abnormal discrepancy between the peak value and the general sound level is recorded.


At least two measurements must be taken on each side of the vehicle.


5.2.2.4.2.Positioning of the microphone


The microphone must be located at a distance of 7,5  0,2 m from the reference line CC%amp% prime; (Figure 1) of the track and 1,2  0,1 m above the ground. Its axis of maximum sensitivity must be horizontal and perpendicular to the path of the vehicle (line CC%amp% prime;).


5.2.2.4.3.Conditions of operation


5.2.2.4.3.1.General conditions


For all measurements, the vehicle must be driven in a straight line over the acceleration section in such a way that the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle is as close as possible to the line CC%amp% prime;.


The vehicle must approach the line AA%amp% prime; at a steady initial road speed as specified in items 5.2.2.4.3.2 and 5.2.2.4.3.3. When the front end of the vehicle has reached the line AA%amp% prime;, the accelerator control is fully operated as rapidly as practicable and held in the fully opened position until the rear of the vehicle reaches the line BB%amp% prime;; the accelerator control must be released as quickly as possible.


The trailers of articulated vehicles which cannot be uncoupled must not be taken into account as regards the crossing of line BB%amp% prime;.


5.2.2.4.3.2.Approach speed


The vehicle must approach the line AA%amp% prime; at a steady speed corresponding to the lower of the following two speeds:


-50 km/h,


-the speed corresponding to an engine speed equal to three-quarters of the speed, S, at which the engine develops its rated maximum power, in the case of vehicles of category M1 and in the case of vehicles of the other categories having an engine power not greater than 225 kW,


-the speed corresponding to an engine speed equal to half the speed, S, at which the engine develops its rated maximum power, in the case of vehicles not belonging to category M1 having an engine power greater than 225 kW.


However, if in the case of vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission having more than two discrete ratios there is a change-down to first gear during the test, the manufacturer may select either of the following test procedures:


-the speed, V, of the vehicle is increased to a maximum of 60 km/h in order to avoid such a change-down,


or


-the speed, V, must remain at 50 km/h and the fuel supply to the engine limited to 95 % of the supply necessary for full load. This condition is considered to be satisfied:


- in the case of a spark-ignition engine, when the angle of the throttle opening is 90 %,


and


-in the case of a compression-ignition engine, when the movement of the central rack of the injection pump is limited to 90 % of its travel.


If the vehicle is equipped with an automatic transmission which has no manual override, it must be tested at different approach speeds, namely 30, 40, and 50 km/h, or at three-quarters of maximum road speed if this value is lower. The test result is that obtained at the speed which produces the maximum sound level.


5.2.2.4.3.3.Choice of gear ratios (in vehicles fitted with gearboxes)


5.2.2.4.3.3.1.Manually-operated, non-automatic gearbox


5.2.2.4.3.3.1.1.Vehicles in categories M1 and N1 equipped with a manually operated gearbox having not more than four forward gear ratios must be tested in second gear.


Vehicles in these categories equipped with a manually operated gearbox having more than four forward gear ratios must be tested in second and third gears successively. Only overall gear ratios intended for normal road use are considered. The arithmetic mean of the sound levels recorded for each of these two conditions shall be calculated.


If during the test in second gear, the engine speed exceeds the engine speed, S, at which the engine develops its rated maximum power, the test must be repeated with an approach speed and/or approach engine speed reduced by steps of 5 % of S until the engine speed attained no longer exceeds S.


However, the vehicles in category M1 having more than four forward gears and equipped with an engine developing a maximum power greater than 140 kW, and whose permissible maximum-power/maximum-mass ratio exceeds 75 kW/t, may be tested in third gear only, provided that the speed at which the rear of the vehicle passes the line BB' in third gear is greater than 61 km/h.


5.2.2.4.3.3.1.2.Vehicles other than those in categories M1 and N1 in which the total number of forward gear ratios is x (including the ratios obtained by means of an auxiliary gearbox or a multiple-ratio drive axle) must be tested using, in turn, ratios equal to or higher than x/n (3) (4).


The test result will be that obtained from the ratio producing the maximum sound level.


Shifting up gears from x/n must be terminated in the gear X where the engine speed, S, at which the engine develops its rated maximum power is for the last time reached when passing the line BB%amp% prime;.


In the case of vehicles having different overall gear ratios (including a different number of gears) the representativity of the type by the test vehicle is determined as follows:


-if the highest sound level is obtained between the ratios x/n and X the vehicle selected is deemed representative of its type,


-if the highest sound level is obtained at ratio x/n the vehicle selected is deemed representative of its type only for those vehicles which have a lower overall gear ratio at x/n,


-if the highest sound level is obtained at ratio X the vehicle selected is deemed representative of its type only for those vehicles which have a higher overall gear ratio at X.


5.2.2.4.3.3.2.Automatic transmission equipped with manual override


The test is conducted with the selector in a position recommended by the manufacturer for 'normal' driving. External downshifts (e.g. kickdown) shall be put out of operation.


5.2.2.5.Interpretation of results


5.2.2.5.1.To take account of inaccuracies in the measuring instruments, the result obtained from each measurement is determined by deducting 1 dB (A) from the meter reading.


5.2.2.5.2.The measurements are considered valid if the difference between two consecutive measurements on the same side of the vehicle does not exceed 2 dB (A).


5.2.2.5.3.The highest sound level measured shall constitute the test result. Should the result exceed the maximum permissible sound level for the category of vehicle tested by 1 dB (A), two further measurements shall be made at the corresponding microphone position. Three of the four measurements thus obtained at that microphone position must fall within the prescribed limits.


5.2.3.Sound level of the stationary vehicle


5.2.3.1.Sound level in the vicinity of vehicles


In order to facilitate subsequent checks on vehicles in use, the sound level must be measured close to the exhaust system outlet in accordance with the following requirements and the measurement results entered in the test report drawn up for the purpose of issuing the certificate referred to in Annex III.


5.2.3.2.Measuring instruments


5.2.3.2.1.Acoustic measurements


A precision sound-level meter as defined in item 5.2.2.2.1 must be used for the measurements.


5.2.3.2.2.Measurement of engine speed


The engine speed is determined by means of a tachometer having an accuracy of 3 % or better. The tachometer may not be the one fitted to the vehicle.


5.2.3.3.Conditions of measurement


5.2.3.3.1.Test site (Figure 2)


Any area not subject to significant acoustic disturbance may be used as a test site. Flat surfaces which are covered in concrete, asphalt or any other hard surfacing and possess a high degree of reflectivity are particularly suitable; surfaces consisting of earth which has been tamped down must not be used.


The test site must be in the form of a rectangle, the sides of which are at least 3 m from the sides of the vehicle. This rectangle must not contain any significant obstacles, e.g. an individual other than the observer and the driver. The vehicle must be positioned within the abovementioned rectangle so that the microphone is at least 1 m from any kerbstone.


5.2.3.3.2.Meteorological conditions


Measurements must not be made in poor atmospheric conditions. It must be ensured that the results are not affected by gusts of wind.


5.2.3.3.3.Ambient noise


Readings on the measuring instruments produced by ambient noise and wind must be at least 10 dB (A) below the sound level to be measured. A suitable windscreen may be fitted to the microphone provided that account is taken of its effect on the sensitivity of the microphone.


5.2.3.3.4.Condition of the vehicle


The vehicle engine must be brought to normal running temperature before measurements commence. If the vehicle is fitted with fan(s) having an automatic actuating mechanism, this system must not be interfered with during the sound-level measurements.


During measurements, the gear lever must be in the neutral position.


5.2.3.4.Method of measurement


5.2.3.4.1.Nature and number of measurements


The maximum sound level expressed in A-weighted decibels (dB (A)) must be measured during the operating period referred to in item 5.2.3.4.3.


At least three measurements must be taken at each measuring point.


5.2.3.4.2.Position of the microphone (Figure 2)


The microphone must be located level with the exhaust outlet or 0,2 m above the test-track surface, whichever is the higher. The microphone diaphragm must face the exhaust outlet at a distance of 0,5 m from the latter. The axis of maximum sensitivity of the microphone must be parallel to the track surface at an angle of 45  10 to the vertical plane defined by the direction in which the exhaust gases are emitted.


The microphone must be positioned to the side of this vertical plane which gives the greatest possible distance between the microphone and the vehicle contour.


If the exhaust system has several outlets, the centres of which are not more than 0,3 m apart, and which are connected to the same silencer, the microphone must face the outlet closest to the vehicle contour or the outlet which is the highest above the track surface. In all other cases separate measurements must be taken at each of them, the highest figure recorded being taken as the test value.


In the case of vehicles fitted with a vertical exhaust outlet (e.g. commercial vehicles), the microphone must be positioned at the level of the exhaust outlet, facing upwards with its axis vertical. It must be positioned at a distance of 0,5 m from the side of the vehicle closest to the exhaust outlet.


Where the design of the vehicle is such that the microphone cannot be located as shown in Figure 2 because of the presence of obstacles which form part of the vehicle (e.g. spare wheel, fuel tank, battery compartment), a drawing clearly indicating the position for the microphone must be made when the measurement is conducted. As far as possible, the microphone must be more than 0,5 m from the nearest obstacle, and its axis of maximum sensitivity must face the exhaust outlet from the position least concealed by the abovementioned obstacles.


5.2.3.4.3. Conditions of engine operation


Engine speed must be stabilized at three-quarters of the speed (S) at which the engine develops rated maximum power.


When constant engine speed is reached, the throttle must be rapidly returned to the idling position. The sound level must be measured over an operating period comprising brief maintenance of constant engine speed and the entire deceleration period, the maximum sound-level meter reading being taken as the test result.


5.2.3.5. Results (test report)


5.2.3.5.1. The test report drawn up for the purpose of issuing the certificate referred to in Annex III must indicate all relevant data, particularly those used in measuring the sound of the stationary vehicle.


5.2.3.5.2. Readings, rounded off to the nearest decibel, shall be taken from the measuring instrument.


Only those values obtained from three consecutive measurements which do not differ by more than 2 dB (A) respectively are taken into consideration.


5.2.3.5.3. The highest of these three values shall constitute the test results.


5.3. Exhaust systems containing fibrous materials


5.3.1. Fibrous materials may not be used in the construction of silencers unless suitable measures are undertaken at the design or production stages to ensure that the efficiency required to comply with the limits imposed in item 5.2.2.1 is achieved on the road. Such a silencer is considered to be efficient on the road if the exhaust gases are not in contact with the fibrous materials or if the silencer of the prototype vehicle tested in accordance with the requirements of items 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 has been put into a normal state for road use before the sound-level measurements are taken. This can be achieved by using one of the three tests described in items 5.3.1.1, 5.3.1.2 and 5.3.1.3, below, or by removing the fibrous materials from the silencer.


5.3.1.1. Continuous road operation for 10 000 km


5.3.1.1.1. About half this operation shall consist of town driving and the other half of long-distance runs at high speed; continuous road operation can be replaced by a corresponding test-track programme.


5.3.1.1.2. The two speed regimes must be alternated on several occasions.


5.3.1.1.3. The complete test programme must include a minimum of 10 breaks of at least three-hours duration in order to reproduce the effects of cooling and any condensation which may occur.


5.3.1.2. Conditioning on a test bench


5.3.1.2.1. Using standard parts and observing the vehicle manufacturer's instructions, the silencer must be fitted to the engine, which is coupled to a dynamometer.


5.3.1.2.2. The test must be conducted in six six-hour periods with a break of at least 12 hours between each period in order to reproduce the effect of cooling and any condensation which may occur.


5.3.1.2.3. During each six-hour period, the engine shall be run under the following conditions in turn:


1. five minutes at idling speed;


2. one-hour sequence under load at of rated maximum speed (S);


3. one-hour sequence under load at of rated maximum speed (S);


4. 10-minute sequence under full load at of rated maximum speed (S);


5. 15-minute sequence under load at rated maximum speed (S);


6. 30-minute sequence under load at rated maximum speed (S).


Total duration of the six sequences: three hours.


Each period must comprise two sets of the six abovementioned sequences.


5.3.1.2.4. During the test, the silencer must not be cooled by a forced draught simulating normal airflow around the vehicle. Nevertheless, at the request of the manufacturer, the silencer may be cooled in order not to exceed the temperature recorded at its inlet when the vehicle is running at maximum speed.


5.3.1.3. Conditioning by pulsation


5.3.1.3.1. The exhaust system or components thereof must be fitted to the vehicle referred to in 2.3 or the engine referred to in 2.4. In the former case the vehicle must be mounted on a roller dynamometer. In the second case, the engine must be mounted on a dynamometer.


The test apparatus, a detailed diagram of which is shown in Figure 3, must be fitted at the outlet of the exhaust system. Any other apparatus providing equivalent results is acceptable.


5.3.1.3.2. The test apparatus must be adjusted in such a way that the exhaust-gas flow is alternately interrupted and re-established by the quick-action valve for 2 500 cycles.


5.3.1.3.3. The valve must open when the exhaust-gas back pressure, measured at least 100 mm downstream of the intake flange, reaches a value of between 0,35 and 0,40 bar. It must close when this pressure does not differ by more than 10 % from its stabilized value with the valve open.


5.3.1.3.4. The time-delay switch shall be set for the duration of gas exhaust resulting from the provisions laid down in item 5.3.1.3.3 above.


5.3.1.3.5. Engine speed must be 75 % of the speed (S) at which the engine develops maximum power.


5.3.1.3.6. The power indicated by the dynamometer must be 50 % of the full-throttle power measured at 75 % of engine speed (S).


5.3.1.3.7. Any drainholes must be closed off during the test.


5.3.1.3.8. The entire test must be completed within 48 hours. If necessary, one cooling period may be observed after each hour.


5.3.2. If the provisions of Article 8 (3) of Directive 70/156/EEC concerning EEC type-approval are to be applied, the test method set out in item 5.3.1.2 above must be employed.


5.4. Compressed air noise


5.4.1. Method of measurement


The measurement is performed at microphone positions 2 and 6 according to Figure 4, with the vehicle stationary. The highest A-weighted noise levels are registered during venting the pressure regulator and during ventilating after the use of both the service and parking brakes.


The noise during venting the pressure regulator is measured with the engine at idling speed.


The ventilating noise is registered while operating the service and parking brakes; before each measurement, the air-compressor unit has to be brought up to the highest permissible operating pressure, and then the engine switched off.


5.4.2. Evaluation of the results


For all microphone positions two measurements are taken. In order to compensate for inaccuracies of the measuring equipment, the meter reading is reduced by 1 dB (A), and the reduced value is taken as the result of measurement. The results are taken as valid if the difference between the measurements at one and the same microphone position does not exceed 2 dB (A).


The highest value measured is taken as the test result. If this value exceeds the noise limit by 1 dB (A), two additional measurements are to be taken at the corresponding microphone position. In this case three out of the four results of measurement thus obtained at that microphone position must have to comply with the noise limit.


5.4.3. Limiting value


The sound level shall not exceed the limit of 72 dB (A).


6. EXTENSION OF EEC TYPE-APPROVAL


6.1. Vehicle types modified to run on unleaded petrol


6.1.1. Approval of a vehicle type modified and/or adjusted solely for the purpose of making it capable of running on unleaded petrol, as specified in Directive 85/210/EEC, is extended when the manufacturer certifies, subject to the approval of the authority granting type approval, that the sound level for the modified vehicle shall not exceed the limiting values specified in item 5.2.2.1.


6.2. Vehicle types modified for any other purpose


6.2.1. Approval of a vehicle type may be extended to vehicle types differing with regard to the characteristics listed in Annex III if the authority granting type approval considers that the modifications made are not likely to have any substantial adverse effect on the sound level of the vehicle.


7. CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION


7.1. Every vehicle manufactured following the requirements of this Directive shall conform to the vehicle type approved, and satisfy the requirements of section 5.


7.2. In order to verify that the requirements of item 7.1 are met, adequate monitoring of the production shall be carried out.

7.3.6. ensure that any sampling or test pieces giving evidence of non-conformity with the type of test considered shall give rise to another sampling and another test. All the necessary steps must be taken to re-establish the conformity of the corresponding production.


7.4. The competent authority which has granted type-approval may at any time verify the conformity control method applicable to each production unit.


7.4.1. At every inspection the test books and production survey records must be presented to the visiting inspector.


7.4.2. The inspector may take samples at random which will be tested in the manufacturer's laboratory. The minimum number of samples may be determined according to the results of the manufacturer's own verification.


7.4.3. When the quality level appears unsatisfactory or when it seems necessary to verify the validity of the tests carried out in application of item 7.4.2 the Inspector must select samples to be sent to the technical service which has conducted the type approval tests.


7.4.4. The competent authority may carry out any test prescribed in Annex I.


7.4.5. The normal frequency of inspections by the competent authority is one every two years. If unsatisfactory results are recorded during one of these visits, the competent authority must ensure that all necessary steps are taken to re-establish the conformity of production as rapidly as possible.

Such a silencing system is deemed to be effective in traffic if the exhaust gases are not in contact with the fibrous materials or if, after the removal of the fibrous materials, the sound levels comply with the requirements set out in 5.2.1, when the exhaust system is tested on a vehicle in accordance with the methods described in sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 of Annex I.


If this condition is not observed, the entire exhaust system must be subjected to conditioning. This must be done using one of the three methods described in sections 5.3.1.1, 5.3.1.2 and 5.3.1.3 of Annex I.


After conditioning, the sound level must be checked as specified in 5.2.1 above.


When the procedure described in item 5.2.1.2 is employed, the applicant for EEC type-approval may ask for the conditioning of the original equipment exhaust system or submit one which has been emptied.


6.CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION


6.1.Any replacement exhaust system or component thereof bearing an EEC type-approval number pursuant to this Directive must conform to the approved type of exhaust system and comply with the requirements of section 5.


6.2.In order to verify that the requirements of item 6.1 are met, adequate monitoring of the production shall be carried out.


6.3.The holder of the approval must in particular:


6.3.1.ensure the existence of procedures for effective control of the quality of products;


6.3.2.have access to the testing equipment necessary for checking the conformity of each approved type;


6.3.3.ensure that test result data are recorded and that annexed documents shall remain available for a period to be determined in agreement with the administrative service;


6.3.4.analyze the results of each type of test, in order to verify and ensure the stability of the product characteristics making allowance for variation of an industrial production;


6.3.5.ensure that for each type of product at least the tests prescribed in Annex V (II) are carried out;


6.3.6.ensure that sampling or test pieces giving evidence of non-conformity in the type of test in question give rise to a further sampling and test. All the necessary steps must be taken to restore conformity of the corresponding production.


6.4.The competent authority which has granted type-approval may at any time verify the conformity control method applicable to each production unit.


6.4.1.At every inspection the test books and production survey records must be presented to the visiting inspector.


6.4.2.The inspector may take samples at random for testing in the manufacturer's laboratory. The minimum number of samples may de determined according to the results of the manufacturer's own verification.


6.4.3.When the quality level appears unsatisfactory or when it seems necessary to verify the validity of the tests carried out in application of 6.4.2, the inspector must select samples to be sent to the technical service which has conducted the type approval tests.


6.4.4.The competent authority may carry out any test prescribed in Annex I.


6.4.5.The normal frequency of inspections by the competent authority is one every two years. If unsatisfactory results are recorded during one of these visits, the competent authority must ensure that all necessary steps are taken to restore conformity of production as rapidly as possible.

1.3.1.systems in which the components bea different trade marks or trade names;


1.3.2.systems in which the characteristics of the materials of a component differ, or in which the components are of different shape or size; a change in the plating procedure (galvanization, aluminium coating, etc.) is not deemed to produce a difference of type;


1.3.3.systems in which the operating principles of at least one component differ;


1.3.4.systems in which the components are combined differently.


1.4.Component of an exhaust or an intake system


means one of the separate components which together form the exhaust system (e.g. exhaust pipes, the silencer proper) or the intake system (e.g. air filter).

5.2.2.2.Measuring instruments


5.2.2.2.1.Acoustic measurements


The apparatus used for measuring the noise level must be a precision sound-level meter of the type described in Publication 179 'Precision sound level meters', second edition, of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Measurements must be carried out using the 'fast' response of the sound-level meter and the 'A' weighting curve which are also described in that publication.


At the beginning and end of each set of measurements, the sound-level meter must be calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions by means of an appropriate sound source (e.g. a pistonphone). The test must be considered invalid if the sound-level meter errors registered during this calibration exceed 1 dB.


5.2.2.2.2.Speed measurements


The engine speed and vehicle speed on the test section shall be determined with an accuracy of 3 % or better.


5.2.2.3.Conditions of measurement


5.2.2.3.1.Test site


The test site must consist of a central acceleration section surrounded by a substantially flat test area. The test acceleration section must be level; the track surface must be dry and such that rolling noise remains low.


The test track must be such that the conditions of a free sound field between the sound source and the microphone are attained to within 1 dB. These conditions shall be deemed to be met if there are no large sound-reflecting objects such as fences, rocks, bridges or buildings within 50 m of the centre of the acceleration section. The test-track surface must comply with the specifications in Annex VI.


There must be no obstacle which could affect the sound field within the vicinity of the microphone and no persons shall stand between the microphone and the sound source. The observer carrying out the measurements must so position himself as not to affect the readings of the measuring instrument.


5.2.2.3.2.Meteorological conditions


Measurements must not be made in poor atmospheric conditions. It must be ensured that the results are not affected by gusts of wind.


5.2.2.3.3.Ambient noise


For measurements, the A-weighted sound level of sound sources other than those of the vehicle to be tested and of wind effects must be at least 10 dB (A) below the sound level produced by the vehicle. A suitable windscreen may be fitted to the microphone provided that account is taken of its effect on the sensitivity and directional characteristics of the microphone.


5.2.2.3.4.Condition of vehicle


For these measurements, the vehicle must be in running order as defined in item 2.6 of Annex I to Directive 70/156/EEC and, except in the case of vehicles which cannot be uncoupled, without trailer or semi-trailer.


The vehicle's tyres must be of the type normally fitted to such vehicles by the manufacturer and must be inflated to the appropriate pressure(s) for the unladen vehicle.


Before the measurements are made, the engine must be brought to its normal operating condition as regards temperatures, settings, fuel, spark plugs, carburettor(s), etc. (as appropriate). If the vehicle is fitted with fan(s) having an automatic actuating mechanism, this system must not be interfered with during the measurements.


Only the normal highway drive must be engaged in vehicles with more than two drive wheels.


5.2.2.4.Method of measurement


5.2.2.4.1.Nature and number of measurements


The maximum sound level expressed in A-weighted decibels (dB (A)) shall be measured as the vehicle is driven between lines AA%amp% prime; and BB%amp% prime; (Figure 1). The measurement shall be invalid if an abnormal discrepancy between the peak value and the general sound level is recorded.


At least two measurements must be taken on each side of the vehicle.


5.2.2.4.2.Positioning of the microphone


The microphone must be located at a distance of 7,5  0,2 m from the reference line CC%amp% prime; (Figure 1) of the track and 1,2  0,1 m above the ground. Its axis of maximum sensitivity must be horizontal and perpendicular to the path of the vehicle (line CC%amp% prime;).


5.2.2.4.3.Conditions of operation


5.2.2.4.3.1.General conditions


For all measurements, the vehicle must be driven in a straight line over the acceleration section in such a way that the median longitudinal plane of the vehicle is as close as possible to the line CC%amp% prime;.


The vehicle must approach the line AA%amp% prime; at a steady initial road speed as specified in items 5.2.2.4.3.2 and 5.2.2.4.3.3. When the front end of the vehicle has reached the line AA%amp% prime;, the accelerator control is fully operated as rapidly as practicable and held in the fully opened position until the rear of the vehicle reaches the line BB%amp% prime;; the accelerator control must be released as quickly as possible.


The trailers of articulated vehicles which cannot be uncoupled must not be taken into account as regards the crossing of line BB%amp% prime;.


5.2.2.4.3.2.Approach speed


The vehicle must approach the line AA%amp% prime; at a steady speed corresponding to the lower of the following two speeds:


-50 km/h,


-the speed corresponding to an engine speed equal to three-quarters of the speed, S, at which the engine develops its rated maximum power, in the case of vehicles of category M1 and in the case of vehicles of the other categories having an engine power not greater than 225 kW,


-the speed corresponding to an engine speed equal to half the speed, S, at which the engine develops its rated maximum power, in the case of vehicles not belonging to category M1 having an engine power greater than 225 kW.


However, if in the case of vehicles equipped with an automatic transmission having more than two discrete ratios there is a change-down to first gear during the test, the manufacturer may select either of the following test procedures:


-the speed, V, of the vehicle is increased to a maximum of 60 km/h in order to avoid such a change-down,


or


-the speed, V, must remain at 50 km/h and the fuel supply to the engine limited to 95 % of the supply necessary for full load. This condition is considered to be satisfied:


- in the case of a spark-ignition engine, when the angle of the throttle opening is 90 %,


and


-in the case of a compression-ignition engine, when the movement of the central rack of the injection pump is limited to 90 % of its travel.


If the vehicle is equipped with an automatic transmission which has no manual override, it must be tested at different approach speeds, namely 30, 40, and 50 km/h, or at three-quarters of maximum road speed if this value is lower. The test result is that obtained at the speed which produces the maximum sound level.


5.2.2.4.3.3.Choice of gear ratios (in vehicles fitted with gearboxes)


5.2.2.4.3.3.1.Manually-operated, non-automatic gearbox


5.2.2.4.3.3.1.1.Vehicles in categories M1 and N1 equipped with a manually operated gearbox having not more than four forward gear ratios must be tested in second gear.


Vehicles in these categories equipped with a manually operated gearbox having more than four forward gear ratios must be tested in second and third gears successively. Only overall gear ratios intended for normal road use are considered. The arithmetic mean of the sound levels recorded for each of these two conditions shall be calculated.


If during the test in second gear, the engine speed exceeds the engine speed, S, at which the engine develops its rated maximum power, the test must be repeated with an approach speed and/or approach engine speed reduced by steps of 5 % of S until the engine speed attained no longer exceeds S.


However, the vehicles in category M1 having more than four forward gears and equipped with an engine developing a maximum power greater than 140 kW, and whose permissible maximum-power/maximum-mass ratio exceeds 75 kW/t, may be tested in third gear only, provided that the speed at which the rear of the vehicle passes the line BB' in third gear is greater than 61 km/h.


5.2.2.4.3.3.1.2.Vehicles other than those in categories M1 and N1 in which the total number of forward gear ratios is x (including the ratios obtained by means of an auxiliary gearbox or a multiple-ratio drive axle) must be tested using, in turn, ratios equal to or higher than x/n (3) (4).


The test result will be that obtained from the ratio producing the maximum sound level.


Shifting up gears from x/n must be terminated in the gear X where the engine speed, S, at which the engine develops its rated maximum power is for the last time reached when passing the line BB%amp% prime;.


In the case of vehicles having different overall gear ratios (including a different number of gears) the representativity of the type by the test vehicle is determined as follows:


-if the highest sound level is obtained between the ratios x/n and X the vehicle selected is deemed representative of its type,


-if the highest sound level is obtained at ratio x/n the vehicle selected is deemed representative of its type only for those vehicles which have a lower overall gear ratio at x/n,


-if the highest sound level is obtained at ratio X the vehicle selected is deemed representative of its type only for those vehicles which have a higher overall gear ratio at X.


5.2.2.4.3.3.2.Automatic transmission equipped with manual override


The test is conducted with the selector in a position recommended by the manufacturer for 'normal' driving. External downshifts (e.g. kickdown) shall be put out of operation.


5.2.2.5.Interpretation of results


5.2.2.5.1.To take account of inaccuracies in the measuring instruments, the result obtained from each measurement is determined by deducting 1 dB (A) from the meter reading.


5.2.2.5.2.The measurements are considered valid if the difference between two consecutive measurements on the same side of the vehicle does not exceed 2 dB (A).


5.2.2.5.3.The highest sound level measured shall constitute the test result. Should the result exceed the maximum permissible sound level for the category of vehicle tested by 1 dB (A), two further measurements shall be made at the corresponding microphone position. Three of the four measurements thus obtained at that microphone position must fall within the prescribed limits.


5.2.3.Sound level of the stationary vehicle


5.2.3.1.Sound level in the vicinity of vehicles


In order to facilitate subsequent checks on vehicles in use, the sound level must be measured close to the exhaust system outlet in accordance with the following requirements and the measurement results entered in the test report drawn up for the purpose of issuing the certificate referred to in Annex III.


5.2.3.2.Measuring instruments


5.2.3.2.1.Acoustic measurements


A precision sound-level meter as defined in item 5.2.2.2.1 must be used for the measurements.


5.2.3.2.2.Measurement of engine speed


The engine speed is determined by means of a tachometer having an accuracy of 3 % or better. The tachometer may not be the one fitted to the vehicle.


5.2.3.3.Conditions of measurement


5.2.3.3.1.Test site (Figure 2)


Any area not subject to significant acoustic disturbance may be used as a test site. Flat surfaces which are covered in concrete, asphalt or any other hard surfacing and possess a high degree of reflectivity are particularly suitable; surfaces consisting of earth which has been tamped down must not be used.


The test site must be in the form of a rectangle, the sides of which are at least 3 m from the sides of the vehicle. This rectangle must not contain any significant obstacles, e.g. an individual other than the observer and the driver. The vehicle must be positioned within the abovementioned rectangle so that the microphone is at least 1 m from any kerbstone.


5.2.3.3.2.Meteorological conditions


Measurements must not be made in poor atmospheric conditions. It must be ensured that the results are not affected by gusts of wind.


5.2.3.3.3.Ambient noise


Readings on the measuring instruments produced by ambient noise and wind must be at least 10 dB (A) below the sound level to be measured. A suitable windscreen may be fitted to the microphone provided that account is taken of its effect on the sensitivity of the microphone.


5.2.3.3.4.Condition of the vehicle


The vehicle engine must be brought to normal running temperature before measurements commence. If the vehicle is fitted with fan(s) having an automatic actuating mechanism, this system must not be interfered with during the sound-level measurements.


During measurements, the gear lever must be in the neutral position.


5.2.3.4.Method of measurement


5.2.3.4.1.Nature and number of measurements


The maximum sound level expressed in A-weighted decibels (dB (A)) must be measured during the operating period referred to in item 5.2.3.4.3.


At least three measurements must be taken at each measuring point.


5.2.3.4.2.Position of the microphone (Figure 2)


The microphone must be located level with the exhaust outlet or 0,2 m above the test-track surface, whichever is the higher. The microphone diaphragm must face the exhaust outlet at a distance of 0,5 m from the latter. The axis of maximum sensitivity of the microphone must be parallel to the track surface at an angle of 45  10 to the vertical plane defined by the direction in which the exhaust gases are emitted.


The microphone must be positioned to the side of this vertical plane which gives the greatest possible distance between the microphone and the vehicle contour.


If the exhaust system has several outlets, the centres of which are not more than 0,3 m apart, and which are connected to the same silencer, the microphone must face the outlet closest to the vehicle contour or the outlet which is the highest above the track surface. In all other cases separate measurements must be taken at each of them, the highest figure recorded being taken as the test value.


In the case of vehicles fitted with a vertical exhaust outlet (e.g. commercial vehicles), the microphone must be positioned at the level of the exhaust outlet, facing upwards with its axis vertical. It must be positioned at a distance of 0,5 m from the side of the vehicle closest to the exhaust outlet.


Where the design of the vehicle is such that the microphone cannot be located as shown in Figure 2 because of the presence of obstacles which form part of the vehicle (e.g. spare wheel, fuel tank, battery compartment), a drawing clearly indicating the position for the microphone must be made when the measurement is conducted. As far as possible, the microphone must be more than 0,5 m from the nearest obstacle, and its axis of maximum sensitivity must face the exhaust outlet from the position least concealed by the abovementioned obstacles.


5.2.3.4.3. Conditions of engine operation


Engine speed must be stabilized at three-quarters of the speed (S) at which the engine develops rated maximum power.


When constant engine speed is reached, the throttle must be rapidly returned to the idling position. The sound level must be measured over an operating period comprising brief maintenance of constant engine speed and the entire deceleration period, the maximum sound-level meter reading being taken as the test result.


5.2.3.5. Results (test report)


5.2.3.5.1. The test report drawn up for the purpose of issuing the certificate referred to in Annex III must indicate all relevant data, particularly those used in measuring the sound of the stationary vehicle.


5.2.3.5.2. Readings, rounded off to the nearest decibel, shall be taken from the measuring instrument.


Only those values obtained from three consecutive measurements which do not differ by more than 2 dB (A) respectively are taken into consideration.


5.2.3.5.3. The highest of these three values shall constitute the test results.


5.3. Exhaust systems containing fibrous materials


5.3.1. Fibrous materials may not be used in the construction of silencers unless suitable measures are undertaken at the design or production stages to ensure that the efficiency required to comply with the limits imposed in item 5.2.2.1 is achieved on the road. Such a silencer is considered to be efficient on the road if the exhaust gases are not in contact with the fibrous materials or if the silencer of the prototype vehicle tested in accordance with the requirements of items 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 has been put into a normal state for road use before the sound-level measurements are taken. This can be achieved by using one of the three tests described in items 5.3.1.1, 5.3.1.2 and 5.3.1.3, below, or by removing the fibrous materials from the silencer.


5.3.1.1. Continuous road operation for 10 000 km


5.3.1.1.1. About half this operation shall consist of town driving and the other half of long-distance runs at high speed; continuous road operation can be replaced by a corresponding test-track programme.


5.3.1.1.2. The two speed regimes must be alternated on several occasions.


5.3.1.1.3. The complete test programme must include a minimum of 10 breaks of at least three-hours duration in order to reproduce the effects of cooling and any condensation which may occur.


5.3.1.2. Conditioning on a test bench


5.3.1.2.1. Using standard parts and observing the vehicle manufacturer's instructions, the silencer must be fitted to the engine, which is coupled to a dynamometer.


5.3.1.2.2. The test must be conducted in six six-hour periods with a break of at least 12 hours between each period in order to reproduce the effect of cooling and any condensation which may occur.


5.3.1.2.3. During each six-hour period, the engine shall be run under the following conditions in turn:


1. five minutes at idling speed;


2. one-hour sequence under load at of rated maximum speed (S);


3. one-hour sequence under load at of rated maximum speed (S);


4. 10-minute sequence under full load at of rated maximum speed (S);


5. 15-minute sequence under load at rated maximum speed (S);


6. 30-minute sequence under load at rated maximum speed (S).


Total duration of the six sequences: three hours.


Each period must comprise two sets of the six abovementioned sequences.


5.3.1.2.4. During the test, the silencer must not be cooled by a forced draught simulating normal airflow around the vehicle. Nevertheless, at the request of the manufacturer, the silencer may be cooled in order not to exceed the temperature recorded at its inlet when the vehicle is running at maximum speed.


5.3.1.3. Conditioning by pulsation


5.3.1.3.1. The exhaust system or components thereof must be fitted to the vehicle referred to in 2.3 or the engine referred to in 2.4. In the former case the vehicle must be mounted on a roller dynamometer. In the second case, the engine must be mounted on a dynamometer.


The test apparatus, a detailed diagram of which is shown in Figure 3, must be fitted at the outlet of the exhaust system. Any other apparatus providing equivalent results is acceptable.


5.3.1.3.2. The test apparatus must be adjusted in such a way that the exhaust-gas flow is alternately interrupted and re-established by the quick-action valve for 2 500 cycles.


5.3.1.3.3. The valve must open when the exhaust-gas back pressure, measured at least 100 mm downstream of the intake flange, reaches a value of between 0,35 and 0,40 bar. It must close when this pressure does not differ by more than 10 % from its stabilized value with the valve open.


5.3.1.3.4. The time-delay switch shall be set for the duration of gas exhaust resulting from the provisions laid down in item 5.3.1.3.3 above.


5.3.1.3.5. Engine speed must be 75 % of the speed (S) at which the engine develops maximum power.


5.3.1.3.6. The power indicated by the dynamometer must be 50 % of the full-throttle power measured at 75 % of engine speed (S).


5.3.1.3.7. Any drainholes must be closed off during the test.


5.3.1.3.8. The entire test must be completed within 48 hours. If necessary, one cooling period may be observed after each hour.


5.3.2. If the provisions of Article 8 (3) of Directive 70/156/EEC concerning EEC type-approval are to be applied, the test method set out in item 5.3.1.2 above must be employed.


5.4. Compressed air noise


5.4.1. Method of measurement


The measurement is performed at microphone positions 2 and 6 according to Figure 4, with the vehicle stationary. The highest A-weighted noise levels are registered during venting the pressure regulator and during ventilating after the use of both the service and parking brakes.


The noise during venting the pressure regulator is measured with the engine at idling speed.


The ventilating noise is registered while operating the service and parking brakes; before each measurement, the air-compressor unit has to be brought up to the highest permissible operating pressure, and then the engine switched off.


5.4.2. Evaluation of the results


For all microphone positions two measurements are taken. In order to compensate for inaccuracies of the measuring equipment, the meter reading is reduced by 1 dB (A), and the reduced value is taken as the result of measurement. The results are taken as valid if the difference between the measurements at one and the same microphone position does not exceed 2 dB (A).


The highest value measured is taken as the test result. If this value exceeds the noise limit by 1 dB (A), two additional measurements are to be taken at the corresponding microphone position. In this case three out of the four results of measurement thus obtained at that microphone position must have to comply with the noise limit.


5.4.3. Limiting value


The sound level shall not exceed the limit of 72 dB (A).


6. EXTENSION OF EEC TYPE-APPROVAL


6.1. Vehicle types modified to run on unleaded petrol


6.1.1. Approval of a vehicle type modified and/or adjusted solely for the purpose of making it capable of running on unleaded petrol, as specified in Directive 85/210/EEC, is extended when the manufacturer certifies, subject to the approval of the authority granting type approval, that the sound level for the modified vehicle shall not exceed the limiting values specified in item 5.2.2.1.


6.2. Vehicle types modified for any other purpose


6.2.1. Approval of a vehicle type may be extended to vehicle types differing with regard to the characteristics listed in Annex III if the authority granting type approval considers that the modifications made are not likely to have any substantial adverse effect on the sound level of the vehicle.


7. CONFORMITY OF PRODUCTION


7.1. Every vehicle manufactured following the requirements of this Directive shall conform to the vehicle type approved, and satisfy the requirements of section 5.


7.2. In order to verify that the requirements of item 7.1 are met, adequate monitoring of the production shall be carried out.


7.3. The holder of the approval shall in particular:

7.3.6. ensure that any sampling or test pieces giving evidence of non-conformity with the type of test considered shall give rise to another sampling and another test. All the necessary steps must be taken to re-establish the conformity of the corresponding production.


7.4. The competent authority which has granted type-approval may at any time verify the conformity control method applicable to each production unit.


7.4.1. At every inspection the test books and production survey records must be presented to the visiting inspector.


7.4.2. The inspector may take samples at random which will be tested in the manufacturer's laboratory. The minimum number of samples may be determined according to the results of the manufacturer's own verification.


7.4.3. When the quality level appears unsatisfactory or when it seems necessary to verify the validity of the tests carried out in application of item 7.4.2 the Inspector must select samples to be sent to the technical service which has conducted the type approval tests.


7.4.4. The competent authority may carry out any test prescribed in Annex I.

If the sound level of the exhaust system or component, tested pursuant to sections 1 and 2, measured in accordance with section 5.2 of Annex II, does not exceed by more than 1 dB (A) the level measured during the EEC type-approval tests of this type of exhaust system or component, the exhaust system or component type is considered to conform to the requirements of this Directive.


4.2. If the exhaust system or component tested according to 4.1 does not satisfy the requirements laid down in that section, two more exhaust systems or components of the same type must be tested pursuant to sections 1 and 2 above.


4.3. If the sound level of the second and/or third sample of 4.2 exceeds by more than 1 dB (A) the level measured during the EEC type-approval tests of this type of exhaust system or component, the exhaust system or component type is considered not to conform to the requirements of this Directive and the manufacturer must take the necessary measures to restore the conformity.


ANNEX VI


TEST TRACK SPECIFICATIONS


This Annex lays down specifications relating to the physical characteristics of the paving and the layout of the test track paving.


1. REQUIRED CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SURFACE


A surface is considered to conform to this Directive provided that the texture and voids content or sound absorption coefficient have been measured and found to fulfill all the requirements given in 1.1 to 1.4 and provided that the design requirements (Section 2.2) have been met.


1.1. Residual voids content


The residual voids content, Vc, of the test track paving mixture shall not exceed 8 %. See section 3.1 for measurement procedure.


1.2. Sound absorption coefficient


If the surface fails to comply with the residual voids content requirement, the surface is acceptable only if its sound absorption coefficient, a, is %amp% le; 0,10. See section 3.2 for measurement procedure.


The requirement of section 1.1. and 1.2. is met also if only sound absorption has been measured and found to be: a %amp% le; 0,10.


1.3. Texture depth


The texture depth (TD) measured according to the volumetric method (see section 3.3) shall be:


TD %amp% ge; 0,4 mm.


1.4. Homogeneity of the surface


Every practical effort shall be taken to ensure that the surface is made to be as homogenous as possible within the test area. This includes the texture and voids content, but it should also be observed that if the rolling process results in more effective rolling at some places than at others, the texture may be different and uneveness causing bumps may also occur.


1.5. Period of testing


In order to check whether the surface continues to conform to the texture and voids content or sound absorption requirements stipulated in this standard, periodic testing of the surface shall be done at the following intervals:


(a) for residual voids content or sound absorption:


- when the surface is new,


- if the surface meets the requirement when new, no further periodical testing is required.


If it does not meet the requirement when it is new, it may do so later because surfaces tend to become clogged and compacted with time;


(b) for texture depth (TD):


- when the surface is new,


- when the noise testing starts (NB: not before four weeks after laying),


- then every twelve months.


2. TEST SURFACE DESIGN


2.1. Area


When designing the test track layout it is important to ensure that, as a minimum requirement, the area traversed by the vehicles running through the test strip is covered with the specified test material with suitable margins for safe and practical driving. This will require that the width of the track is at least 3 m and the length of the track extends beyond lines AA and BB by at least 10 m at either end. Figure 1 shows a plan of a suitable test site and indicates the minimum area which shall be machine laid and machine compacted with the specified test surface material.


Figure 1


Minimum requirements for test surface area


The shaded part is called 'test area'


2.2. Design requirements for the surface


The test surface shall meet four design requirements:


1. it shall be a dense asphaltic concrete;


2. the maximum chipping size shall be 8 mm (tolerances allow from 6,3 to 10 mm);


3. the thickness of the wearing course shall be %amp% ge; 30 mm;


4. the binder shall be a straight penetration grade bitumen without modification.


As a guide to the test surface constructor, an aggregate grading curve which will give desired characteristics is shown in figure 2. In addition, table 3 gives some guidelines in order to obtain the desired texture and durability. The grading curve fits the following formula:


P (% passing) = 100 (d/dmax)


where


d= square mesh sieve size, in mm


dmax=8 mm for the mean curve


dmax=10 mm for the lower tolerance curve


dmax=6,3 mm for the upper tolerance curve


In addition to the above, the following recommendations are given:


- the sand fraction (0,063 mm %lt% square mesh sieve size %lt% 2 mm) shall include no more than 55 % natural sand and at least 45 % crushed sand,


- the base and sub-base shall ensure a good stability and evenness, according to best road construction practice,


- the chippings shall be crushed (100 % crushed faces) and of a material with a high resistance to crushing,


- the chippings used in the mix shall be washed,


- no extra chippings shall be added on to the surface,


- the binder hardness expressed as PEN value shall be 40 to 60, 60 to 80 or even 80 to 100, depending on the climatic conditions of the country. The rule is that as hard a binder as possible shall be used, provided this is consistent with common practice,


- the temperature of the mix before rolling shall be chosen so as to achieve by subsequent rolling the required voids content. In order to increase the probability of satisfying the specifications of sections 1.1 to 1.4, the compactness shall be studied not only by an appropriate choice of mixing temperature, but also by an appropriate number of passings and by the choice of compacting vehicle.

3. TEST METHODS


3.1. Measurement of the residual voids content


For the purpose of this measurement, cores have to be taken from the track at least at four different positions which are equally distributed in the test area between lines AA and BB (see figure 1). In order to avoid inhomogeneity and unevenness in the wheel tracks, cores should not be taken in the wheel tracks themselves, but close to them. Two cores (minimum) should be taken close to the wheel tracks and one core (minimum) should be taken approximately midway between the wheel tracks and each microphone location.


If there is a suspicion that the condition of homogeneity is not met (see section 1.4), cores shall be taken from more locations within the test area.


The residual voids content has to be determined for each core. Then the average value from all cores shall be calculated and compared with the requirement of section 1.1. In addition, no single core shall have a voids value which is higher than 10 %.


The test surface constructor is reminded of the problem which may arise when the test area is heated by pipes or electrical wires and cores must be taken from this area. Such installations must be carefully planned with respect to future core drilling locations. It is recommended to leave a few locations of size approximately 200  300 mm where there are no wires or pipes, or where the latter are located deep enough in order not to be damaged by cores taken from the surface layer.


3.2. Sound absorption coefficient


The sound absorption coefficient (normal incidence) shall be measured by the impedance tube method using the procedure specified in ISO/DIS 10534: 'Acoustics - Determination of sound absorption coefficient and impedance by a tube method'.


Regarding test specimens, the same requirements shall be followed as regarding the residual voids content (see section 3.1).


The sound absorption shall be measured in the range 400 to 800 Hz and in the range 800 to 1 600 Hz (at least at the centre frequencies of third octave bands) and the maximum values shall be identified for both of these frequency ranges. Then these values, for all test cores, shall be averaged to constitute the final result.


3.3. Volumetric macrotexture measurement


For the purposes of this standard, texture depth measurements shall be made on at least 10 positions evenly spaced along the wheel tracks of the test strip and the average value taken to compare with the specified minimum texture depth. See Annex F to Draft Standard ISO/DIS 10844 for a description of the procedure.


4. STABILITY IN TIME AND MAINTENANCE


4.1. Age influence


In common with many other surfaces, it is expected that the tyre/road noise levels measured on the test surface may increase slightly during the first six to 12 months after construction.


The surface will achieve its required characteristics not earlier than four weeks after construction. The influence of age on the noise from trucks is generally less than that from cars.


The stability over time is determined mainly by the polishing and compaction by vehicles driving on the surface. It shall be periodically checked as stated in section 1.5.


4.2. Maintenance of the surface


Loose debris or dust which could significantly reduce the effective texture depth must be removed from the surface. In countries with winter climates, salt is sometimes used for de-icing. Salt may alter the surface temporarily or even permanently in such a way as to increase noise and is therefore not recommended.


4.3. Repaving the test area


If it is necessary to repave the test track, it is usually unnecessary to repave more than the test strip (of 3 m width in figure 1) where vehicles are driving provided the test area outside the strip met the requirement of residual voids content or sound absorption when it was measured.


5. DOCUMENTATION OF THE SURFACE AND OF TESTS PERFORMED ON IT


5.1. Documentation of the test surface


The following data shall be given in a document describing the test surface:


(a) the location of the test track;


(b) type of binder, binder hardness, type of aggregate, maximum theoretical density of the concrete ('DR'), thickness of the wearing course and grading curve determined from cores from the test track;

(i) the residual voids content of each core;


(ii) the locations in the test area from where the cores for voids measurement have been taken;


(iii) the sound absorption coefficient of each core (if measured). Specify the results both for each core and each frequency range as well as the overall average;


(iv) the locations in the test area from where the cores for absorption measurement have been taken;


(v) texture depth, including the number of tests and standard deviation;


(vi) the institution responsible for tests (i) and (iii) and the type of equipment used;

Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3830/92 of 28 December 1992 relative to the suppression of customs duties and fixed components to trade between the Community of Ten and Spain and to the application by Spain of the duties from the Common Customs Tariff to trade with non-member countries from 1 January 1993




COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 3830/92 of 28 December 1992 relative to the suppression of customs duties and fixed components to trade between the Community of Ten and Spain and to the application by Spain of the duties from the Common Customs Tariff to trade with non-member countries from 1 January 1993


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal, and in particular Article 75 (4) thereof,


Whereas the Act of Accession provides for the possibility of suppressing the customs duties and other components applicable to trade of agricultural products between Spain and the Community of Ten; that the same dispositions allow for an accelerated alignment of customs duties from Spain to the Common Customs Tariff; that the same rule is applicable under Article 78 of the Act for the reduction in Spain of the fixed components designed to ensure the protection of the processing industry;


Whereas Spain has put a request in this direction;


Whereas the completion of the single market without internal frontiers as from 1 January 1993 makes necessary the suppression of customs duties and other components to trade between the Community of Ten and Spain and the application of the same import customs duties to trade with non-member countries;


Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinions of all Management Committees concerned,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


1. From 1 January 1993:


- Spain suppresses trade with the Community of Ten of products subject to common organization of the market, customs duties and fixed components intended to ensure protection of the processing industry,


- customs duties and fixed components intended to ensure protection of the processing industry applicable by the Community of Ten on imports from Spain are suppressed.


2. From 1 January 1993 Spain applies the customs duties applicable by the Community of Ten to trade with non-member countries.


Article 2


This Regulation shall enter into force from 1 January 1993. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2410/92 of 23 July 1992 amending Regulation (EEC) No 3975/87 laying down the procedure for the application of the rules on competition to undertakings in the air transport sector


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 87 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1) ,


Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament(2) ,


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3) ,


Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3975/87(4) formed part of a package of interrelated measures adopted by the Council as a first step towards completing the internal market in transport; whereas its scope was accordingly limited to international air transport between Community airports;


Whereas, therefore, the Commission has no means at present of investigating directly cases of suspected infringement of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty and lacks the powers to take decisions or impose such penalties as are necessary for it to authorize agreements under Article 85 (3) and to bring to an end infringements established by it in relation to transport within a Member State;


Whereas air transport entirely within a Member State is now also subject to Community liberalization measures; whereas it is therefore desirable for rules to be laid down under which the Commission, action in close and constant liaison with the competent authorities of the Member States, may take the requisite measures for the application of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty to this area of air transport, in situations where trade between Member States may be affected;


Whereas there is a need to establish a secure and clear legal framework for air transport within a Member State, while ensuring consistent application of the competition rules; whereas, therefore, the scope of Regulation (EEC) No 2975/87 should be extended to this area of air transport,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


The word 'international' is hereby deleted from Article 1 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 3975/87.


Article 2


This Regulation shall enter into force on the day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities.


This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/100/EEC of 19 November 1992 on rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 57 (2), 66 and 100a thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas differences exist in the legal protection provided by the laws and practices of the Member States for copyright works and subject matter of related rights protection as regards rental and lending; whereas such differences are sources of barriers to trade and distortions of competition which impede the achievement and proper functioning of the internal market;


Whereas such differences in legal protection could well become greater as Member States adopt new and different legislation or as national case-law interpreting such legislation develops differently;


Whereas such differences should therefore be eliminated in accordance with the objective of introducing an area without internal frontiers as set out in Article 8a of the Treaty so as to institute, pursuant to Article 3 (f) of the Treaty, a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted;


Whereas rental and lending of copyright works and the subject matter of related rights protection is playing an increasingly important role in particular for authors, performers and producers of phonograms and films; whereas piracy is becoming an increasing threat;


Whereas the adequate protection of copyright works and subject matter of related rights protection by rental and lending rights as well as the protection of the subject matter of related rights protection by the fixation right, reproduction right, distribution right, right to broadcast and communication to the public can accordingly be considered as being of fundamental importance for the Community's economic and cultural development;


Whereas copyright and related rights protection must adapt to new economic developments such as new forms of exploitation;


Whereas the creative and artistic work of authors and performers necessitates an adequate income as a basis for further creative and artistic work, and the investments required particularly for the production of phonograms and films are especially high and risky; whereas the possibility for securing that income and recouping that investment can only effectively be guaranteed through adequate legal protection of the rightholders concerned;


Whereas these creative, artistic and entrepreneurial activities are, to a large extent, activities of self-employed persons; whereas the pursuit of such activities must be made easier by providing a harmonized legal protection within the Community;


Whereas, to the extent that these activities principally constitute services, their provision must equally be facilitated by the establishment in the Community of a harmonized legal framework;


Whereas the legislation of the Member States should be approximated in such a way so as not to conflict with the international conventions on which many Member States' copyright and related rights laws are based;


Whereas the Community's legal framework on the rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright can be limited to establishing that Member States provide rights with respect to rental and lending for certain groups of rightholders and further to establishing the rights of fixation, reproduction, distribution, broadcasting and communication to the public for certain groups of rightholders in the field of related rights protection;


Whereas it is necessary to define the concepts of rental and lending for the purposes of this Directive;


Whereas it is desirable, with a view to clarity, to exclude from rental and lending within the meaning of this Directive certain forms of making available, as for instance making available phonograms or films (cinematographic or audiovisual works or moving images, whether or not accompanied by sound) for the purpose of public performance or broadcasting, making available for the purpose of exhibition, or making available for on-the-spot reference use; whereas lending within the meaning of this Directive does not include making available between establishments which are accessible to the public;


Whereas, where lending by an establishment accessible to the public gives rise to a payment the amount of which does not go beyond what is necessary to cover the operating costs of the establishment, there is no direct or indirect economic or commercial advantage within the meaning of this Directive;


Whereas it is necessary to introduce arrangements ensuring that an unwaivable equitable remuneration is obtained by authors and performers who must retain the possibility to entrust the administration of this right to collecting societies representing them;


Whereas the equitable remuneration may be paid on the basis of one or several payments an any time on or after the conclusion of the contract;


Whereas the equitable remuneration must take account of the importance of the contribution of the authors and performers concerned to the phonogram or film;


Whereas it is also necessary to protect the rights at least of authors as regards public lending by providing for specific arrangements; whereas, however, any measures based on Article 5 of this Directive have to comply with Community law, in particular with Article 7 of the Treaty;


Whereas the provisions of Chapter II do not prevent Member States from extending the presumption set out in Article 2 (5) to the exclusive rights included in that chapter; whereas furthermore the provisions of Chapter II do not prevent Member States from providing for a rebuttable presumption of the authorization of exploitation in respect of the exclusive rights of performers provided for in those articles, in so far as such presumption is compatible with the International Convention for the Protection of Performers, Producers of Phonograms and Broadcasting Organizations (hereinafter referred to as the Rome Convention);


Whereas Member States may provide for more far-reaching protection for owners of rights related to copyright than that required by Article 8 of this Directive;


Whereas the harmonized rental and lending rights and the harmonized protection in the field of rights related to copyright should not be exercised in a way which constitutes a disguised restriction on trade between Member States or in a way which is contrary to the rule of media exploitation chronology, as recognized in the Judgment handed down in Socit Cinthque v. FNCF (4),


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE: CHAPTER I RENTAL AND LENDING RIGHT

COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 3046/92 of 22 October 1992 laying down provisions implementing and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91 of 7 November 1991 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States (1), and in particular Article 30 thereof,


Whereas, with a view to establishing the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States, the field of application of the Intrastat system should be precisely defined in relation to both the goods to be included and those to be excluded;


Whereas the date from which the intra-Community operator shall in practice comply with his obligations to supply information must be determined; whereas the extent of the obligations of the third party to whom the party responsible for providing the information may transfer that task should be defined;


Whereas certain of the rules to be complied with by the departments concerned must be specified in detail in particular with a view to efficient management of the registers of intra-Community operation; whereas it is useful to specify the provisions relating to certain fiscal aspects of statistical information;


Whereas there should be additions to the definition of the data to be reported and to the arrangements for reporting such data;


Whereas a list should be drawn up of the goods to be excluded from the statistical returns relating to the trading of goods;


Whereas account should be taken initially of existing simplified procedures and of the special requirements of certain sectors;


Whereas the amendments to Council Directive 77/388/EEC (2) by Directive 91/680/EEC (3) require certain provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91 to be adapted, pursuant to the first indent of Article 33 thereof;


Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee on the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


With a view to establishing the statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States, the Community and its Member States shall apply Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91, hereinafter referred to as the Basic Regulation, in accordance with the rules laid down in this Regulation.


Article 2


1. In connection with trade between the Community as constituted on 31 December 1985 and Spain or Portugal, and between those two last-mentioned Member States, the Intrastat system shall also apply to goods still liable to certain customs duties and charges having equivalent effect or which remain subject to other measures laid down by the Act of Accession.


2. The Intrastat system shall apply to the products referred to in Article 3 (1) of Council Directive 92/12/EEC (4), regardless of the form and content of the document accompanying them, when they move between the territories of the Member States.


Article 3


1. The Intrastat system shall not apply:


(a) to goods placed or obtained under the inward processing customs procedure (suspension system) or the procedure of processing under customs control;


(b) to goods circulating between parts of the statistical territory of the Community, at least one of which is not part of the territory of the Community pursuant to Council Directive 77/388/EEC.


2. The Member States shall be responsible for collecting data on the goods referred to in paragraph 1 on the basis of the customs procedures applicable to such goods.


3. If the statistical copy of the Single Administrative Document containing the data listed in Article 23 of the Basic Regulation, with the exception of the information referred to in paragraph 2 (e) of that Article, is not available, the customs departments shall at least once a month send the relevant statistical departments a periodic list of those same data by type of goods, in accordance with the arrangements agreed upon by the said departments.


4. Articles 2, 4, 8, 9, 12 (1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7); 13, 14, 19, 21 and 22 (3) (a) and (b), first indent, shall not apply to the goods referred to in paragraph 1.


The other provisions of this Regulation shall apply to these goods without prejudice to any customs regulations which otherwise apply.


Article 4


1. Any natural or legal person carrying out an intra-Community operation for the first time, whether the goods are arriving or being dispatched, shall become responsible for providing the required information within the meaning of Article 20 (5) of the Basic Regulation.


2. The party referred to in paragraph 1 shall provide the data on his intra-Community operations via the periodic declarations referred to in Article 13 of the Basic Regulation as from the month during which the assimilation threshold is exceeded, in accordance with the provisions relating to the threshold which become applicable to him.


The Member States shall determine the deadline for transmission in line with their particular administrative organization.


3. When the VAT registration number of a party responsible for providing the information is amended as a result of a change of ownership, name, address, legal status or similar change which does not affect his intra-Community operations to a significant extent, the rule defined in paragraph 1 need not be applied to the party in question at the time of the change. It shall remain subject to the statistical obligations to which it was subject before the change.


Article 5


1. The third party referred to in Article 9 (1) of the Basic Regulation is hereinafter referred to as the declaring third party.


2. The declaring third party shall provide the competent national departments with the following information:


(a) in accordance with Article 6 (1), the information necessary:


- to identify himself,


- to identify each of the parties responsible for providing the information who have transferred this task to him;


(b) for each of the parties responsible for providing information, the data required by the Basic Regulation and in implementation thereof.


Article 6


1. The information necessary to identify an intra-Community operator within the meaning of Article 10 of the Basic Regulation shall be the following:


- full name of the person or firm,


- full address including post code,


- under the circumstances laid down in Article 10 (6) of the Basic Regulation, the VAT registration number.


However, the statistical departments referred to in Article 10 (1) of the Basic Regulation may dispense with one or more of the abovementioned items of information or, under circumstances to be determined by them, exempt the intra-Community operators from providing them.


In the Member States referred to in Article 10 (3) of the Basic Regulation, the information which serves to identify an intra-Community operator shall be supplied to the abovementioned statistical departments by the tax authorities referred to in the said Article as and when it becomes available to the latter, unless there is an agreement to the contrary between the departments concerned.


2. The minimum of list data to be recorded in the register of intra-Community operators, within the meaning of Article 10 of the Basic Regulation, shall contain, for each intra-Community operator, the following:


(a) the year and month of entry in the register;


(b) the information necessary to identify the operator as laid down in paragraph 1;


(c) where applicable, whether the operator is the consignor, consignee or declarant, or, as from 1 January 1993, a party responsible for providing information or a declaring third party, upon either consignment or receipt; in the Member States referred to in Article 10 (3) of the Basic regulation, the information stipulated in paragraph 1 of the present Article shall show whether each operator in question is a consignor or a consignee;


(d) in the case of a consignor or consignee or, as from 1 January 1993, a party responsible for providing information, the total value of his intra-Community operations, by month and by flow, together with, as from that same date, the value referred to in Article 11 (3) of the Basic Regulation; however, this information need not be recorded:


- prior to 1993, in those Member States referred to in Article 10 (3) of the Basic Regulation,


- if the checking of the information recorded as statistics using the information referred to in Article 11 (3) of the Basic Regulation and the functioning of the statistical thresholds referred to in Article 28 of the said Regulation are organized separately from the management of the register of intra-Community operators.


The competent national departments may record other data in the register in accordance with their requirements.


Article 7


With a view to implementing Article 10 (6) of the Basic Regulation, the case where responsibility for the information, for given operations, lies not with the operator as a legal entity per se but with a constituent part of this entity, such as a branch office, a kind-of-activity unit or local unit, may be considered a justified exception.


Article 8


In the lists referred to in Article 11 (1) of the Basic Regulation, the tax authorities responsible shall mention intra-Community operators who, as a result of a scission, merger or cessation of activity during the period under review, will no longer appear on the said lists.


Article 9


1. The party responsible for providing information shall transmit the data required under the Basic Regulation and in implementation thereof:


(a) in accordance with the Community provision in force;


(b) direct to the competent national departments or via the collection offices which the Member States have set up for this or for other statistical or administrative purposes;


(c) for a given reference period, at his discretion:


- either by means of a single declaration, within a time limit which the competent national departments shall lay down in their instructions to the parties responsible for providing information and which shall be between the fifth and the tenth working day following the end of that period,


- or by means of several part-declarations; in this case, the competent national departments may require agreement to be reached with them on the frequency of transmission and deadlines, but the last part-declaration must be transmitted within the time limit laid down under the first indent above.


2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, a party responsible for providing information who benefits from exemption by virtue of application of the assimilation threshold provided for in Article 28 (4) of the Basic Regulation must, when transmitting the information, conform only to the regulations of the tax authorities responsible.


3. Pursuant to Article 34 of the Basic Regulation, the provisions of this Article relating to the periodicity of the declaration shall not prevent the conclusion of an agreement providing for the supply of data in real time, when the data are transmitted electronically.


4. By way of derogation to paragraph 1 above, in those Member States where the periodic statistical declaration is the same as the periodic tax declaration, the provisions relating to the transmission of the statistical declaration shall be drawn up in line with Community or national tax regulations.


Article 10


In the medium for the information, the Member States whose statistical territory is described in the nomenclature of countries annexed to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1736/75 (5) shall be designated by either alphabetical or numerical codes, as follows:

Article 12


1. The value of the goods, as referred to in Article 23 (1) (d) of the Basic Regulation, shall be given as follows:


- by type of goods, the statistical value,


- by statistical declaration, the amount invoiced.


2. The statistical value shall be fixed:


- upon dispatch, on the basis of the taxable amount to be determined the taxation purposes in accordance with Directive 77/388/EEC for deliveries of goods specified under section A (1) (a) and, where appropriate, for the operations specified under section A (1) (b) of Article 11 of the same Directive, minus, however, any taxes deductible because of the dispatch; it shall, on the other hand, include transport and insurance costs relating to that part of the journey which takes place on the statistical territory of the Member State of dispatch,


- upon arrival, on the basis of the taxable amount to be determined for taxation purposes, in accordance with Article 28e of the Directive referred to above, for acquisition of goods, minus, however, taxes due because of the release for consumption and transport and insurance costs relating to that part of the journey which takes place on the statistical territory of the Member State of arrival.


The statistical value must be declared in accordance with the first subparagraph, even if the taxable amount does not have to be determined for taxation purposes.


For goods resulting from processing operations, the statistical value shall be established as if those goods had been produced entirely in the Member State of processing.


3. The amount invoiced shall be the total amount (excluding VAT) of invoices or documents serving as invoices relating to all the goods included in a statistical declaration.

In this case, they shall calculate the statistical value and exempt the party responsible for providing the statistical information from the need to mention it. However, those responsible for providing the information may be required to supply information on ancillary costs on a sample basis.


The second subparagraph shall apply either to all parties required to transmit the periodic declaration referred to in Article 13 (1) of the Basic Regulation or solely to those parties who benefit from the application of simplification thresholds.


5. The Member States may exercise the option laid down in the second subparagraph of paragraph 4, even if their particular administrative organization prevents them from taking the simplification measure which, by virtue of this subparagraph, must accompany the exercise of this option, namely, exemption from the requirement to mention the statistical value.


In the instructions relating to the statistical declaration to the parties responsible for providing information, the technical reasons why both the statistical value and the invoiced amount must be mentioned, by type of goods, shall be indicated in advance.


The Member States shall transmit a copy of these instructions to the Commission before 1 November 1992 and, thereafter, whenever they are updated.

COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 92/71/EEC of 2 September 1992 determining the percentage of consignments that could be subject to phytosanitary inspection, documentary and identity checking, when introduced into a Member State from another Member State


THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Directive 77/93/EEC of 21 December 1976 on protective measures against the introduction into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products and against their spread within the Community (1), as last amended by Commission Directive 92/10/EEC (2), and in particular Article 11 (3), third subparagraph and Article 11 (3a) thereof,


Whereas, at present, in addition to providing for checks by consignor Member States, Directive 77/93/EEC allows checks by Member States of destination;


Whereas, moreover, the provisions of Directive 77/93/EEC stipulate that the percentage of phytosanitary inspections to be carried out shall be lower than 33 % and shall be gradually reduced to reach zero by the time that Member States have brought into effect the new checking arrangements in compliance with the provisions intended for the completion of the internal market; whereas in respect of documentary and identity checks, the provisions also stipulate that the percentage of consignments subject to such checks shall be determined and gradually reduced to reach zero by the time that Member States have brought into effect the new checking arrangements in compliance with the provisions intended for the completion of the internal market;


Whereas, in the interest of the free movement of plants, plant products or other objects within the Community, which is an element essential to agricultural productivity and contributes to the proper functioning of the common agricultural policy, the percentage of the abovementioned phytosanitary inspections should be reduced, whilst a decision should be taken in respect of the percentage of consigments that could be subject to occasional documentary and identity checks, and a better balance established, in the matter of checks and inspections between the consignor Member State and the Member State of destination, with greater responsibility being placed on the former;


Whereas the conditions provided for in this Directive are in accordance with the opinion of the Standing Committee on Plant Health,


HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:


Article 1


The Member states shall ensure that from 15 October 1992:


(a) the percentage of official phytosanitary inspections referred to in Article 11 (3), third subparagraph of Directive 77/93/EEC, to be carried out when consignments are introduced into a Member State from another Member State, shall be lower than 10;


(b) the percentage of consignments subject to occasional documentary and identity checks referred to in Article 11 (3a) of the said Directive shall be lower than 10.


Article 2


1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations or administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 14 October 1992. They shall immediately inform the Commission thereof.


When Member States adopt these provisions, these shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference at the time of their official publication. The procedure for such reference shall be laid down by Member States.


2. Member States shall immediately communicate to the Commission all provisions of domestic law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive. The Commission shall inform the other Member States thereof.

Council Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92 of 18 June 1992 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products




COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1768/92 of 18 June 1992 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,


Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),


In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),


Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),


Whereas pharmaceutical research plays a decisive role in the continuing improvement in public health;


Whereas medicinal products, especially those that are the result of long, costly research will not continue to be developed in the Community and in Europe unless they are covered by favourable rules that provide for sufficient protection top encourage such research;


Whereas at the moment the period that elapses between the filing of an application for a patent for a new medicinal product and authorization to place the medicinal product on the market makes the period of effective protection under the patent insufficient to cover the investment put into the research;


Whereas this situation leads to a lack of protection which penalizes pharmaceutical research;


Whereas the current situation is creating the risk of research centres situated in the Member States relocating to countries that already offer greater protection;


Whereas a uniform solution at Community level should be provided for, thereby preventing the heterogeneous development of national laws leading to further disparities which would be likely to create obstacles to the free movement of medicinal products within the Community and thus directly affect the establishment and the functioning of the internal market;


Whereas, therefore, the creation of a supplementary protection certificate granted, under the same conditions, by each of the Member States at the request of the holder of a national or European patent relating to a medicinal product for which marketing authorization has been granted is necessary; whereas a Regulation is therefore the most appropriate legal instrument;


Whereas the duration of the protection granted by the certificate should be such as to provide adequate effective protection; whereas, for this purpose, the holder of both a patent and a certificate should be able to enjoy an overall maximum of fifteen years of exclusively from the time the medicinal product in question first obtains authorization to be placed on the market in the Community;


Whereas all the interests at stake, including those of public health, in a sector as complex and sensitive as the pharmaceutical sector must nevertheless be taken into account; whereas, for this purpose, the certificate cannot be granted for a period exceeding five years; whereas the protection granted should furthermore be strictly confined to the product which obtained authorization to be placed on the market as a medicinal product;


Whereas a fair balance should also be struck with regard to the determination of the transitional arrangements; whereas such arrangements should enable the Community pharmaceutical industry to catch up to some extent with its main competitors who, for a number of years, have been covered by laws guaranteeing them more adequate protection, while making sure that the arrangements do not compromise the achievement of other legitimate objectives concerning the health policies pursued both at national and Community level;


Whereas the transitional arrangements applicable to applications for certificates filed and to certificates granted under national legislation prior to the entry into force of this Regulation should be defined;


Whereas special arrangements should be allowed in Member States whose laws introduced the patentability of pharmaceutical products only very recently;


Whereas provision should be made for appropriate limitation of the duration of the certificate in the special case where a patent term has already been extended under a specific national law,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1

Council Regulation (EEC) No 3068/92 of 23 October 1992 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of potassium chloride originating in Belarus, Russia or Ukraine




COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3068/92 of 23 October 1992 imposing a definitive anti-dumping duty on imports of potassium chloride originating in Belarus, Russia or Ukraine


THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,


Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,


Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 of 11 July 1988 on protection against dumped or subsidized imports from Countries not members of the European Economic Community (1), and in particular Article 11 thereof,


Having regard to the proposal presented by the Commission after consultation within the Advisory Committee as provided for in that Regulation,


Whereas:


A. PROVISIONAL MEASURES


(1) By Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92 (2), the Commission imposed a provisional anti-dumping duty on imports into the Community of potassium chloride originating in Belarus, Russia or Ukraine. By Regulation (EEC) No 2442/92 (3) the Council extended this duty for a period ot exceeding two months.


B. SUBSEQUENT PROCEDURE


(2) Following the imposition of the provisional anti-dumping duty, the Belarussian, Russian and Ukrainian exporters, the Community producers and certain importers requested and were granted a hearing by the Commission. They also submitted comments in writing.


(3) The parties' oral and written comments were considered, and the Commission altered its conclusions accordingly where necessary.


(4) This investigation was not concluded within the period specified in Article 7 (9) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88 owing to the complexity of the proceedings, particularly the detailed checking of the many figures and arguments put forward.


C. PRODUCT, LIKE PRODUCT


(5) The product which is the target of the proceeding is potassium chloride or potash muriate (termed 'potash'), and is usually used as an agricultural fertilizer. Information gathered during the Investigation shows that potash is available in two grades: 'standard' (powder) or 'granulated' (granules). As explained in recitals 8 to 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92, the potassium content (expressed as the percentage of the weight of the dry anhydrous product represented by K2O) of both grades varies. Each grade has three different specifications: K2O content of 40 % or less, K2O content of between 40 and 62 %, and K2O content of over 62 %. The three specifications correspond to CN codes 3104 20 10, 3104 20 50 and 3104 20 90.


(6) For the purposes of the preliminary conclusions, the 'over 62 %' specification was disregarded, for the reasons given in recital 10 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92.


Following the hearings conducted after the publication of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92, the Commission decided to take the 'over 62 %' specification into account for its final findings, as it emerged from the information gathered that although this specification was most often used in pharmaceuticals and industry its physical and chemical characteristics were largely identical to the specifications with a lower potassium content, and it could therefore be used in their place. The Commission therefore considered the different grades and specifications of potash to be one and the same product.


It should be pointed out, however, that the specification with the highest potassium content does not exist in granulated form at the moment, seemingly for technical and economic reasons. It is therefore unnecessary to distinguish between the standard and granulated grades in the case of potash with a K2O content of over 62 %. The Council confirms these findings.


D. DUMPING


(a) Normal value


(7) Since Belarus, Russia and Ukraine are still considered non-market economy countries, normal value had to be calculated in accordance with Article 2 (5) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88. The choice of Canada, the world's second largest producer, was not disputed by any of the parties, and normal value was therefore established on the basis of Canadian domestic prices in the case of granular potash and on Canadian and US prices for standard potash, Canadian sales of which were too low to constitute a representative basis relative to imports into the Community from the former USSR.


(8) Since the production costs of the mining firm which assisted in the investigation were greater than Canadian and US market prices, the Community producers asked for normal value to be assessed on the basis of that firm's production costs. However, during the investigation, the Commission verified that Canadian and US market prices still made it possible for other producers to make profits in normal trade transactions. It then emerged that the firm was bearing temporary and exceptional costs because of the special situation of the area of Canada in which its mine was located, and because the mine had started operations a short time before. To add these costs to those of the exports from the former USSR would have been unfair and contrary to


Article 2


(5) (a) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.


Establishing normal value on the basis of price levels on the competitive Canadian and US markets is therefore a reasonable and appropriate approach.


The Council confirms the Commission's findings and the findings given in recitals 13 to 16 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92.


(b) Export price


(9) The export prices of potash exported by producers in the former USSR were determined in the manner described in recitals 17 to 20 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92, and in accordance with the terms of Article 2 (8) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 2423/88.


(c) Comparison


(10) Normal value and export prices were compared at the ex-mine stage, transaction by transaction.


(11) Certain importers pressed for an adjustment in connection with the deduction of sea freight costs, arguing that they used cheaper (when compared to other companies) vessels from the former USSR for transportation between the ports of the former USSR and the Community. The costs selected by the Commission were those actually paid by the main importer. The Commission calculated the sea freight costs on that basis, obtaining a figure lower than that established in Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92.


(12) In connection with haulage costs between the mines and ports of the former USSR, which had been calculated on the basis of Canadian mines and ports as described in recital 20 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92, one importer claimed that account should be taken of the fact that one of the three production sites (the Belaruskali mine) was closer to a port. This was considered, and nothing was found in the record of the proceeding or in the importers' or exporters' replies to indicate that it was possible to determine the source of potash imported into the Community from the former USSR, and thus the portion which had come from the closest mine. The Commission therefore judged it reasonable and appropriate to assume that each site contributed an equal portion of potash exports to the Community. The cost of transporting the potash between plants and ports in the former USSR was therefore determined on the basis of Canadian transport costs, while taking into account the distances between each of the production sites in the former USSR and the ports.


(13) The exporters and some of the importers claimed that there was a difference in grade and in the anti-caking treatments supposedly necessary for certain end-uses which justified a downward adjustment of the prices of potash from the former USSR. In the light of the fact that the chemical characteristics of potash from Canada, the former USSR and the Community are strictly identical, the Commission had to dismiss the argument concerning quality. With regard to the argument concerning anti-caking treatment, the Commission found no difference in manufacturing processes, and the investigation showed no proof that potash originating in the countries of the former USSR needed any kind of special treatment when compared to potash from other countries in order to make it fit for use. No adjustment was therefore found to be justified.


(14) The Commission did, however, observe that potash from the former USSR did not always exactly match potash from the Community and Canada in terms of crystal size. The exporters and a number of importers furthermore pointed out that deliveries and shipping of potash from the former USSR were less reliable, while these considerations do not alter the fundamental characteristics of the product, the Commission thought an adjustment of the order of 2 % to be reasonable in the light of the consumers' image of potash from the former USSR. The Council confirms these findings.


E. DUMPING MARGIN


(15) The final examination of the facts revealed that potash from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine had been dumped. The dumping margin is equal to the difference between the normal value and the export price. In view of the way in which the exporters which participated in the investigation were organized and the fact that they were represented by a single state organization, a single dumping margin was calculated for all of them. The average weighted dumping margin so calculated was 24 % of the total cif value of the exports in question. The Council confirms these findings.


F. INJURY


(16) The Commission pointed out in its preliminary conclusions that substantial injury had been caused to Community producers (recitals 24 to 33 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92). No new argument was put forward in this connection. The Council confirms that Community producers have suffered substantial injury.


G. CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN DUMPING AND INJURY


(17) In recitals 34 to 37 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92, the Commission pointed out that the increase in the volume of cheaper potash exports from the countries of the former USSR had coincided with growing losses in the Community industry. All the parties concerned agreed that the potash market was a transparent one and extremely sensitive to price changes. It was thus clear that imports of potash from the former USSR at prices below those charged by the Community industry had caused that industry serious injury.


With regard to other considerations, the possibility of exports from other sources affecting the Community industry could not be dismissed. The Commission made a distinction between the potential effects of such imports and the injury caused by the imports which are the subject of this proceeding, however. The reason for this was the relatively small volume of imports from other sources and the absence of evidence of price undercutting. The Commission was furthermore aware that the demand for potash has decreased in the last few years. The effects of this consideration have, however, been dissociated from the injury caused by imports from the former USSR. In fact the injury is mainly indicated by more pronounced losses. The Commission investigation, moreover, did not yield any findings proving or likely to constitute proof that the Community producers' management practices could have contributed to the injury sustained.


(18) In the light of the foregoing and the reasons put forward in recitals 34 to 37 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92, the Council confirms that dumped imports of potash from Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, taken in isolation, have caused serious injury to Community producers.


H. DUTY


(19) The Commission has recalculated the level of duty needed to remove the injury according to the method set out in recital 38 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92. No objections to this method were expressed, and the Council confirms that the definitive duty should be equal to the dumping margin.


With regard to the form of the duty, the Commission moreover considers that the margin of manoeuvre available to exporters in countries which still have no market economy, and the effect on the entire potash market of even slight price undercutting, mean that neither a fixed-rate nor an ad valorem duty would be certain to remove the injury caused by dumping. Since no new arguments have been advanced on this issue, the Commission has concluded that an anti-dumping duty should be adopted in the form of a minimum price.


(20) Since the value of the products is related essentially to their K2O content, the minimum price should be calculated definitively for the standard and granulated grades of each of the three specifications according to the method set out in recital 40 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92. The Council confirms these findings.


I. COMMUNITY INTEREST


(21) The parties have presented no further facts or arguments concerning Community interest to the Commission. The Council confirms the Commission's conclusions, contained in recitals 41 to 48 of Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92, that it is in the Community's interest to remove the injury caused by the observed dumping of exports from Belarus, Russia and Ukraine, and thus to halt the decline of Community output without denying the exporters concerned access to the Community market.


J. UNDERTAKING


(22) The Belarussian, Russian and Ukrainian exporters offered to propose a price undertaking. However, the offer concerned an undertaking in principle and was not based on any specific price. The Commission considered this simple undertaking in principle to be unacceptable, and informed the exporters concerned of its decision and the reasons behind it.


K. COLLECTION OF THE PROVISIONAL DUTY


(23) In view of the size of the dumping margins established and the degree of injury to the Community industry, the Council judges it necessary to collect the amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duty up to the level of the definitive duty, with the balance being released,


HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:


Article 1


1. A definitive anti-dumping duty is hereby imposed on imports of potassium chloride (KCl) falling within CN codes 3104 20 10, 3104 20 50 and 3104 20 90, originating in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.


The duty shall be equal to the difference between the minimum prices shown below and the net, free-at-Community-frontier price before customs clearance:


- potassium chloride with a K2O content of 40 % or less:


- standard grade: ECU 57,95 per tonne of KCl (Taric code 3104 20 10*10),


- granulated grade: ECU 65,76 per tonne of KCl (Taric code 3104 20 10*20);


- potassium chloride with a K2O content of over 40 % but less than or equal to 62 %:


- standard grade: ECU 86,93 per tonne of KCl (Taric code 3104 20 50*10),


- granulated grade: ECU 98,65 per tonne of KCl (Taric code 3104 20 50*20);


- potassium chloride with a K2O content of over 62 %:


ECU 133,87 per tonne of KCl.


2. The provisions in force with regard to customs duties shall apply.


Article 2


The amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duty pursuant to Regulation (EEC) No 1031/92 shall be definitively collected up to the levels resulting from the application of the definitive duties imposed in Article 1 (1).


The balance of the security collected shall be released.


Article 3


This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
